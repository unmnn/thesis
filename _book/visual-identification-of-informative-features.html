<!-- The term medical condition is a nosological broad term that includes all diseases, disorders, injuries and syndromes, and it is specially suitable in the last case, in which it is not possible to speak about a single disease associated to the clinical course of the patient.  --><!-- Based on [@Niemann:Pheno2020; @Niemann:SREP2020; @Niemann:PONE2020; @Niemann:Frontiers2020] --><!-- ## Phenotyping --><p>The supervised methods of classification and subgroup discovery described in the previous chapters show great potential for applications where there is one or a small number of well-defined target variables.
However, some medical conditions have heterogeneous appearances which are not well understood yet.
For example, chronic tinnitus is a complex, multi-factorial and heterogeneous symptom.
Clinical assessment and selection of a suitable therapy strategies are difficult as not all patients benefit equally from treatment.
Due to the large number and heterogeneity of available assessment tools, unsupervised methods like cluster analysis appear to be promising approaches to extract clinically relevant tinnitus phenotypes.
Clinical acceptance of these empirical results can be further strengthened by a comprehensive visualization which intuitively illustrate major characteristics of a phenotype and differences between multiple phenotypes.
In this chapter, we describe a workflow (1) to identify distinct tinnitus phenotypes by a parameter-free clustering algorithm and (2) to visualize these subgroups to explore phenotype idiosyncrasies.
In Section <a href="visual-identification-of-informative-features.html#phenotypes-motivation">7.1</a>, we describe the clinical value of patient subgroup stratification, briefly review previous approaches and list requirements for a clustering solution.
We specify the features used for clustering in Section <a href="visual-identification-of-informative-features.html#phenotypes-features">7.2</a>, give an overview of the clustering algorithm in Section <a href="visual-identification-of-informative-features.html#phenotypes-xmeans">7.3</a>, introduce our cluster visualization in Section <a href="visual-identification-of-informative-features.html#phenotypes-visualization">7.4</a> and our interactive web application in Section <a href="visual-identification-of-informative-features.html#phenotypes-app">7.5</a>.
In Section <a href="visual-identification-of-informative-features.html#phenotypes-results">7.6</a>, we present the phenotypes and describe their major characteristics.<br>
The medical interpretation of our findings was developed together with tinnitus experts and is provided in Section <a href="visual-identification-of-informative-features.html#phenotypes-clinical-interpretation">7.7</a>. Finally, we conclude the chapter by a discussion of the strength and weaknesses of our workflow (Section <a href="visual-identification-of-informative-features.html#phenotypes-discussion">7.8</a>).</p>

<span class="header-section-number">7.1</span> Motivation and comparison with related work<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#phenotypes-motivation"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Challenges for management and treatment of tinnitus are caused to a large extend by its clinical heterogeneity, which includes individual perception, risk factors, comorbidities, degrees of perceived stress and treatment response (cf. Section <a href="medical-background-datasets.html#cha">3.6.4</a>).
These factors make it difficult for clinicians (a) to choose <em>the</em> treatment which is most effective for an individual patient, and (b) to design a unified treatment strategy all patients equally benefit from.
The awareness of the existence of distinct patient subgroups may stimulate the development of more effective therapy modules.
Since clinically relevant subgroups have not been established yet, clustering emerges as a promising approach to identify characteristic tinnitus <em>phenotypes</em> in a data-driven and hypothesis-free way.</p>
<p>Previous studies found subgroups of tinnitus patients with cluster analysis based on a small number of audiometric features <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-Langguth:LCA2017" role="doc-biblioref">[2]</a></span>, a combination of features extracted from self-reports, audiometry and psychoacoustics <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-Tyler:TinnitusClustering2008" role="doc-biblioref">[3]</a></span>, or neuroimaging data and
socio-demographics <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-Schecklmann:BrainResearch2012" role="doc-biblioref">[4]</a></span>.
Although each of these studies provided insights in tinnitus subgroup patterns, acceptance among medical scholars may be increased by presenting the clustering results with intuitive visualizations that show individual subgroup patterns and enable the visual juxtaposition of multiple subgroups with respect to high-dimensional data.</p>
<p>Addressing this requirement, Schlee et al. <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-Schlee:RadarVis2017" role="doc-biblioref">[5]</a></span> proposed a compact radar chart visualization that allows to compare the degree of health burden between individuals or subgroups based on measurements from self-report questionnaires.
While their visualization could be applied to any disease domain, Schlee et al. demonstrated its efficacy showing subgroup differences with respect to measurements of tinnitus distress and associated comorbidities.
However, they did not aim to visualize clustering results, but restricted themselves to pre-defined cohorts by graphically comparing female against male patients, and patients with low tinnitus frequency against patients with high tinnitus frequency.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> Selection of Measurement Instruments<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#phenotypes-features"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Discussions with tinnitus experts about the selection of measurement instruments (hereafter denoted as <em>features</em>) for clustering resulted in two main requirements:
(1) features should cover the clinical heterogeneity of tinnitus to a great degree, and
(2) if available, more robust compound scores should be preferred over single items from a questionnaire.
From the routine questionnaire assessment battery (cf. Section <a href="medical-background-datasets.html#cha">3.6.4</a>), we selected a total of 64 features<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;The complete list of features is provided in Appendix &lt;a href="appx-pheno.html#appx-pheno"&gt;A&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>1</sup></a> from 14 questionnaires.
These include all questionnaire total scores, all questionnaire subscale scores and all items of questionnaires that have neither subscales nor total scores.
The features measure
(general) tinnitus characteristics,
physical quality of life,
experiences of pain,
somatic expressions,
affective symptoms,
tinnitus-related distress,
internal resources,
perceived stress, and
mental quality of life.</p>
<p>From a total of 4,103 patients, data from 2,875 (70.1%) was incomplete and therefore excluded.
The N=1,228 patients included in the final sample were only slightly, yet significantly younger than the excluded ones (<span class="math inline">\(\mu_{included}\)</span> = 50.0, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{included}\)</span> = 11.9; <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{excluded}\)</span> = 51.7, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{excluded}\)</span> = 13.6; <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>(2630.8) = 4.0, p <span class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span> 0.01).
Additionally, for 989 of the included patients patients (80.5%) post-treatment data were also available and used to visually explore treatment effect differences between clusters.
Since most of the features have greater scores for higher health burden, we reversed the remaining features with greater scores for higher quality of life.
A feature <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is reversed as
<span class="math display">\[X_{reversed} = \max{(X)} - X.\]</span><br>
The asterisk suffix in a feature name (e.g. ACSA_qualityoflife*) denotes a reversed feature.
Due to widely differing value ranges, each feature was standardized via z-score normalization.
A feature <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> with expected value <span class="math inline">\(E(X)=\mu\)</span> and variance <span class="math inline">\(Var(X) = \sigma^2\)</span> is standardized into
<span class="math display">\[Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}.\]</span>
For <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>, it holds true that <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> = 0 and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span> = 1.</p>

</h2>
<p>Practical considerations of data clustering include how to set the number of clusters <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>.
Since a ground truth is often not available, several heuristics to automatically determine <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> have been proposed.
A popular approach is the so called “elbow” method which involves running the clustering algorithm with different values for <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>.
The number of clusters is plotted against cluster <em>compactness</em>.
In the popular <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>-means algorithm, cluster compactness is quantified by total within-sum of squares (WSS), the sum of squared distances between each observation and its centroid over all clusters.
As WSS or similar goodness of fit measures increase monotonically with increasing <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>, the idea of the elbow method is to identify the curve’s characteristic “knee point” which is the first point from which adding another cluster leads only to a <em>minor</em> improvement in compactness.
Because the plot is not guaranteed to exhibit such a distinctive knee point and universal compactness thresholds do not exist, this approach is often impracticable.
Another popular clustering evaluation measure is the Silhouette coefficient which favor clusterings where similar objects are assigned to the same cluster and dissimilar objects are assigned to different cluster.</p>
<p>Instead of a evaluating clustering quality post-hoc, we decided to chose an algorithm which internally identifies an appropriate number of clusters.
X-means <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-Pelleg:xmeans2000" role="doc-biblioref">[6]</a></span> is a parameter-free adaption of the popular K-means algorithm which incorporates the Bayesian information criterion <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-Schwarz:BIC1978" role="doc-biblioref">[7]</a></span> (BIC) to find a good trade-off between low total sum of squares and a small number of clusters.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{D}\)</span> be the dataset with <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> dimensions and let <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> be a subset of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{D}\)</span>, i.e., <span class="math inline">\(D\subseteq \mathcal{D}\)</span>.
A K-means clustering on <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> creates the set of clusters
<span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}=\left\{C_1,\ldots,C_k,\ldots,C_K\right\}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(c_k\)</span> is the centroid of cluster <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(r_k\)</span> is the number of objects in <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> assigned to <span class="math inline">\(C_k\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is the number of free parameters, i.e., <span class="math inline">\(p = (d+1) \cdot K\)</span>.
The BIC of a cluster <span class="math inline">\(C_k\)</span> using the Schwarz criterion is calculated as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{BIC}(C_k) = \hat{l}_k(\mathcal{D}) - \frac{p_k}{2} \cdot \log |\mathcal{D}|\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\hat{l}_k(\mathcal{D})\)</span> is the log-likelihood of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{D}\)</span> according to <span class="math inline">\(C_k\)</span>.
The point probabilities are computed as
<span class="math display">\[\hat{P}(x_i)=\frac{r_{(i)}}{|\mathcal{D}|}\cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\hat{\sigma}}\text{exp}\left(\frac{1}{2\hat{\sigma}^2}||x_i-c_{(i)}||\right)\]</span>
<!-- !!! herausfinden ob -1/2 im exponent -->
where the maximum likelihood estimate for the variance (under the identical spherical Gaussian assumption) is
<span class="math display">\[\hat{\sigma}^2=\frac{1}{|\mathcal{D}|-K}\sum_{i=1}^{|\mathcal{D}|}\left(x_i - \mu_{(i)}\right)^2.\]</span>
The log-likelihood of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{D}\)</span> according to <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> is
<span class="math display">\[l(\mathcal{D})=\log\prod_{i=1}^{|\mathcal{D}|} P(x_i)=\sum_{i=1}^{|\mathcal{D}|}\left(\log \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\hat{\sigma}} - \frac{1}{2 \sigma^2} ||x_i-c_{(i)}||^2 + \log \frac{r_{(i)}}{|\mathcal{D}|}  \right).\]</span></p>
<p>The main steps of the X-means algorithm are summarized in Figure <a href="visual-identification-of-informative-features.html#fig:06-xmeans">7.1</a>.
At the start, an initial partitioning is generated by ordinary K-means with <span class="math inline">\(K=K_{lower}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(K_{lower}\)</span> is a lower bound for the number of clusters.
Then, each cluster is bisected; the resulting two child centroids are placed in opposite direction along a randomly chosen vector by a distance proportional to the cluster radius.
For each pair of child clusters, a local K-means clustering with <span class="math inline">\(K=2\)</span> is run.
If the BIC score of the new partitioning exceeds the BIC score of the parental one, the child centroids are kept, otherwise the parent centroid is retained.
The iterative steps are repeated until there is no cluster whose bisection leads to a better BIC score, or until the number of clusters exceeds an (optional) upper bound <span class="math inline">\(K_{upper}\)</span>.
We used the R implementation of Ishioka <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-Ishioka:xmeansimplementation2005" role="doc-biblioref">[8]</a></span>.
Since we did not aim to restrict the solution space with resepect to the number of clusters, we set <span class="math inline">\(K_{lower}=2\)</span>, i.e., the lowest possible value, and we did not set <span class="math inline">\(K_{upper}\)</span>.
<!-- Numbering of clusters as cluster 1, cluster 2, etc. was done arbitrarily.  -->
For internal validation, we recorded the number of clusters produced by <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>-means on 500 bootstrap samples.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">7.4</span> Visualisation of phenotypes<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#phenotypes-visualization"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Visualization of clusters in high dimensional data is challenging.
Scatterplot matrices (SPLOMs) can intuitively represent the
relationship between all features pairs as matrix of two-dimensional scatterplots <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-Klemm:RegressionHeatmap2015" role="doc-biblioref">[10]</a></span>.
However, with increasing number of features the number of scatterplots grows quadratically which leads to scalability problems such as overplotting.
Various advanced visualization techniques have been proposed as remedy, from simply adding transparency or colors to points to more sophisticated density contours, hexagon binning, layers showing aggregated geometric characteristics (minimal spanning trees, alpha shape, convex hull), animation, or combinations of multiple techniques such as
splatterplots <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-Mayorga:Splatterplots2013" role="doc-biblioref">[11]</a></span>.
Still, SPLOMs and other traditional visualization techniques such as parallel coordinate charts <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-Hartigan:PCC1975" role="doc-biblioref">[12]</a></span> are still rather suited for low-dimensional data.</p>
<p>Dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques are often applied to project the original data onto a low-dimensional projections which makes it possible to use the above mentioned visualization types.
Ideally, this projection preserves the most important structures of the original data, such as relative pairwise distance, clusters, outliers and correlations.
Principal component analysis <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-Hotelling:PCA1933" role="doc-biblioref">[13]</a></span> (PCA) is a seminal DR algorithm that generates linear, orthogonal combinations of the original dimensions.
Each new dimensions, called principal component, holds a loading that quantifies how much variability of the data it covers.
Usually, the first two or three dimensions which carry the highest loadings are selected for visualization.
PCA is not robust in presence of outliers and is unable to capture non-linear relationships.
Multi-dimensional scaling <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-Gower:MDS1966" role="doc-biblioref">[14]</a></span> (MDS) is another early DR technique which puts emphasis on preserving pairwise distances, i.e.,
objects that are close in high-dimensional space should also be close in low-dimensional projected space.
For complex, arbitrarily shaped structures, pairwise distances may be subject to the curse of dimensionality, which can lead to poor results.
<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-stochastic neighborhood embedding <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-VanDerMaaten:tSNE2008" role="doc-biblioref">[15]</a></span> (<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-SNE) and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-mcinnes2018umap" role="doc-biblioref">[16]</a></span> (UMAP) are non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques that visualize a matrix of pairwise-similarities.
The idea is to preserve both global structures like clusters as well as local structures including distances and neighbors.
Both <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-SNE and UMAP can produce superior projections compared to traditional linear techniques, provided their hyperparameters are appropriately tuned.
However, a shortcoming of them is that the attribution of the original features cannot be quantified.
Further, a projection cannot be applied to new observations; instead a new projection must be recomputed.
Due to their stochasticity, different runs with the same hyperparameters can generate different results.
Since the semantics of the original dimensions will be lost, we decided that DR techniques are not appropriate for this application.</p>
<!-- 1. Hyperparameters really matter -->
<!-- Choosing good values isn't easy, and depends on both the data and your goals (eg, how tightly packed the projection ought to be). This is where UMAP's speed is a big advantage - By running UMAP multiple times with a variety of hyperparameters, you can get a better sense of how the projection is affected by its parameters. -->
<!-- 2. Cluster sizes in a UMAP plot mean nothing -->
<!-- Just as in t-SNE, the size of clusters relative to each other is essentially meaningless. This is because UMAP uses local notions of distance to construct its high-dimensional graph representation. -->
<!-- 3. Distances between clusters might not mean anything -->
<!-- Likewise, the distances between clusters is likely to be meaningless. While it's true that the global positions of clusters are better preserved in UMAP, the distances between them are not meaningful. Again, this is due to using local distances when constructing the graph. -->
<!-- 4. Random noise doesn’t always look random. -->
<!-- Especially at low values of n_neighbors, spurious clustering can be observed. -->
<!-- 5. You may need more than one plot -->
<!-- Since the UMAP algorithm is stochastic, different runs with the same hyperparameters can yield different results. Additionally, since the choice of hyperparameters is so important, it can be very useful to run the projection multiple times with various hyperparameters. -->
<p>Discussions with tinnitus experts let to the following set of requirements for cluster visualization:</p>
<ul>
<li>preserve original (interpretable) features,</li>
<li>represent high-dimensional data with dozens of features,</li>
<li>compactly compare multiple clusters at a glance,</li>
<li>juxtapose cluster characteristics with the overall patient mean.</li>
</ul>
<p>Following these requirements, we implemented (a) a radial bar chart as visualization of an individual cluster (Figure <a href="visual-identification-of-informative-features.html#fig:06-all-radial-barcharts">7.2</a>) and (b) a radial line chart visualization to compare multiple clusters at once <a href="visual-identification-of-informative-features.html#fig:06-radar">7.3</a>.
The radial bar chart serves to compare the observations assigned to a single cluster with the total population.
Within-cluster feature averages are represented by bars arranged in a radial layout.
Each bar starts at the black “zero line” which depicts the feature averages of the whole population, i.e., all subjects used for clustering.
As features are standardized (i.e., z-score scaled) prior to clustering, bars inclined to the outside represent feature averages above the population average and bars inclined to the inside represent feature averages below the population average.
For example, a bar whose top is positioned at -1 characterizes a within-cluster feature average that is 1 standard deviation smaller than the population average.
Besides the combination of bar height and bar direction, within-cluster averages are also mapped to bar color by means of a sequential color gradient from dark blue (lower bound) to yellow (population average) to bright red (upper bound).
Gray error lines at the top edge of a bar represent within-cluster standard error.
To enable quick feature localization, features were grouped into expert-defined categories displayed in the inner circle, alongside the cluster name and the number of assigned subjects.
<!-- Tinnitus experts provided these categories which were (in clockwise order):  -->
<!-- tinnitus characteristics,  -->
<!-- physical quality of life,  -->
<!-- experiences of pain,  -->
<!-- somatic expressions,  -->
<!-- affective symptoms,  -->
<!-- tinnitus-related distress,  -->
<!-- internal resources,  -->
<!-- perceived stress, and  -->
<!-- mental quality of life. --></p>

<p>We provide an interactive demo of the cluster solutions and the visualizations as web application<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;The demo is available at &lt;a href="https://unmnn.de/phs/app/" class="uri"&gt;https://unmnn.de/phs/app/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>2</sup></a> (Figure <a href="visual-identification-of-informative-features.html#fig:06-gui-pheno">7.4</a>).
The following interactive components were added:
hovering over bars, lines or feature labels in the visualizations opens tooltips with additional cluster summaries and compact feature descriptions.
Clicking on a feature triggers an additional plot that shows the original (unscaled) distribution of the selected feature stratified by cluster, and if selected, also after treatment.
For continuous features, semi-transparent boxplots placed on violin plot <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-Hintze:Violin1998" role="doc-biblioref">[18]</a></span> layers are shown.
For categorical features, points and error lines represent category proportions and 95% confidence intervals, respectively.
Although clustering was performed on baseline data only, we incorporated indicators of treatment effect to enable a visual discovery of potential inter-cluster differences with respect to treatment efficacy.
For this purpose, we extended the radial bar chart by showing both pre-treatment (T0) and post-treatment (T1) cluster averages as bars placed next to each other.
The ends of a pair of bars are connected by a line with an arrow-head pointing from the T0 score to the T1 score.
To highlight large treatment effect magnitudes, the connecting lines and feature labels are colored by their relative decrease from T0 to T1.
Given the user-specified parameter <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>, i.e., the minimum relative magnitude of difference between T0 and T1 to be considered as change, elements were colored (a) in red if the T1 value was greater than the T0 value by <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> or more, (b) in green if the T0 value was smaller than the T0 value by <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> or less, or else (c) in black, respectively.</p>

<p>Phenotype 1 (PT 1) constitutes the largest subgroup (697 out of 1,228 patients; 56.8%), characterized by considerably below-average symptom expression across tinnitus-related and broader psychosomatic symptom indices, including affective symptoms, perceived stress, tinnitus-related distress and somatic symptoms, as well as (above-average) quality of life and internal resources (Figure <a href="visual-identification-of-informative-features.html#fig:06-all-radial-barcharts">7.2</a> (a)).
As this group of patients seek for help, present themselves in clinic and wish to participate in the multimodal treatment, it can be assumed that they experience psychological distress, but still aim to present themselves as unburdened as possible.
Therefore, this phenotype is labeled as <em>“avoidant group”</em>.
Patients in this subgroup exhibit comparatively high levels of education, employment and low periods of sick leave and psychotherapeutic treatment (Figure <a href="visual-identification-of-informative-features.html#fig:06-inter-group-socio">7.6</a>).
PT 2 comprised 173 patients (14.1%) who reported highest emotional and somatic
burden among all PTs (Figure <a href="visual-identification-of-informative-features.html#fig:06-all-radial-barcharts">7.2</a> (b)).
More specifically, PT 2 represents a patient subgroup with high
psychosomatic-comorbidity and is thus labeled <em>“psychosomatic group”</em>.
This patient subgroup shows high tinnitus burden alongside clinically relevant
impairment across all affective indices including depression, anxiety, and perceived stress.
These affective symptoms appear to align with somatoform expressions of distress including somatic symptoms.
Patients of these subgroup report severely reduced quality of life and reduced coping behavior with more pessimism, less experienced self-efficacy and optimism.
Relative to the whole population, the proportion of women, patients who live alone, are unemployed or show an overall lower educational status is higher in this subgroup.
Patients in this cluster further report to consult more doctors, take more sick days and use more psychotherapy.
PT 2 patients stated the tinnitus sound to be audible in the entire head
with greater percentage than the other groups.
PT 3 contains 187 patients (15.2%) characterized by above-average scores of features measuring somatic complaints and near-average scores for affective symptoms (Figure <a href="visual-identification-of-informative-features.html#fig:06-all-radial-barcharts">7.2</a> (c)).
Since pain scores of SF8_bodilyhealth* and SSKAL_painfrequency were similarly large as for PT2, this patient subset was labeled <em>“somatic group”</em>.
PT 3 includes the oldest subgroup, with the largest proportion of female patients and largest reported time period since tinnitus onset.
Unlike PT3, PT 4 (n=171; 13.9%) exhibits above-average scores for affective scores, components of quality of life and perceived stress (Figure <a href="visual-identification-of-informative-features.html#fig:06-all-radial-barcharts">7.2</a> (d)), e.g. mental component summary score (SF8_mentalcomp*; 0.85) and anxious depression score (BSF_anxdepression; 0.79).
Hence, PT 4 was labeled as <em>“distress group”</em>.
PT 4 represents the youngest of the 4 subgroups (avg. 47.3 years), with the largest fraction of male patients (Figure<a href="visual-identification-of-informative-features.html#fig:06-inter-group-socio">7.6</a>).</p>

<p>We discussed the clinical relevance of the phenotypes with the five tinnitus experts who co-authored the original paper <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-Niemann:SREP_Pheno2020" role="doc-biblioref">[17]</a></span>.</p>
<p>PT 1 (<em>avoidant group</em>) represents more than half of the patient sample.
Besides the actual tinnitus symptom, patients in this subgroup reported few other affective or psychosomatic symptoms.
Because of these patients’ biased presentation (<em>“everything is okay were it not for the tinnitus”</em>), clinicians might easily be led to believe that the assessment of potential other contributors to individual distress is unnecessary.
However, clinical experience strongly suggests a thorough assessment of broader psychosocial stressors.
The psychosocial resourcefulness of this subgroup enables patients to seek help quickly and in a solution-oriented manner.
Adequate tinnitus-specific counseling and individualized (online) therapy modules comprising audiological, psychological or relaxation procedures may possibly represent an adequate treatment strategy for this patient subgroup.</p>
<p>PT 2 (<em>psychosomatic group</em>) represents 15% of patients with high tinnitus burden and clinically relevant impairment across all affective indices, including depression, anxiety and perceived stress.
These affective symptoms appear to strongly interact with somatoform expressions of distress, including physical complaints and somatic symptoms.
Patients of these subgroup reported severely reduced quality of life and reduced coping behavior, higher pessimism, less experienced self-efficacy and optimism.
There is the frequently asked question as to whether increased tinnitus-related distress contributes to increases in depression or vice versa.
In this group, depressive or anxious symptoms may be considered a crucial underlying factor for general symptom burden and treatment must begin by focusing on improving mood and relieving depression.
Here, tinnitus-related distress may need to be seen within a broader context of medical and psychological influencing factors that require patient-individual conceptualization.</p>
<p>PT 3 (<em>somatic group</em>) appears to represent a patient subgroup that is
characterized by somatopsychic symptom expressions, i.e., physical symptoms that may reflect distress and/or underlying medical conditions.
To adequately address the needs of this patient subgroup, multimodal interventions may include a proportion of body-oriented procedures such as relaxation exercises or physiotherapy whose effect, however, should be interpreted with regard to both direct and indirect psychological effects (e.g. through increased senses of well-being or others’ care).</p>
<p>Patients in PT 4 (<em>distress group</em>) reported above-average perceived stress, accompanied with physical exhaustion and anxious-depressive mood.
This group includes rather younger, employed patients and male patients, who indicated chronic distress, potentially being susceptible to burnout syndrome with subjective reduced mental capacity (“hamster wheel”), which is used as a description of the life situation even without tinnitus distress.
Multimodal therapy should initially focus on stress-regulation techniques, including relaxation or individually tailored behavioral modification approaches.
Similar to the highly psychosomatically burdened PT 2, patients in PT 4 could also benefit from longer psychotherapeutic or multimodal treatment procedures (inpatient or rehabilitative).</p>

</h2>
<p>We presented a workflow to find distinct tinnitus phenotypes by clustering using an algorithm that internally determined the optimal number of clusters.
We visualized the characteristics of each individual phenotype and differences across multiple phenotypes by radial bar and radial line charts.
Further, we provided a web application where phenotypes with their treatment effects can be further investigated.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that combines clustering of tinnitus patients with a comprehensive visualization of subgroups in high-dimensional data and interactive components for an exploration of patterns and treatment effects.</p>
<p>Although for our dataset the optimal number of clusters was four, we expect that this number may be different for another sample of tinnitus patients even with the same clustering algorithm.
Figure <a href="visual-identification-of-informative-features.html#fig:06-bootstrap-eval">7.5</a> indicates high variance with respect to the number of clusters returned by <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>-means on different bootstrap samples.
Considering the just slightly lower occurrence of 5 and 6 clusters, our clustering result is certainly not carved in stone.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the juxtaposition of all clusters revealed that some questionnaires and characteristics were distinctly different between patient phenotypes.
In particular, patient subgroups differed substantially with respect to coping attitudes, stress, tinnitus distress, perceived pain, complaints and perception of quality of life.
In contrast, patients do not seem to differ with respect to locality and sound.
Concerning separability between phenotypes, the mostly high correlations between subgroups of features indicate that phenotyping may be achievable also with less questionnaires, especially because some of the questionnaires are overlapping, e.g. PHQK_depression, ISR_depression, ADSL_depression etc.</p>
<p>Without a ground truth and due to the different sets of available measurements, it is difficult to compare our results to findings of similar studies.
The major strength of our workflow was the incoporation of a wide range of self-report questionnaire assessments.
Other studies also used used audiometrics <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-Langguth:LCA2017" role="doc-biblioref">[2]</a>, <a href="references.html#ref-Tyler:TinnitusClustering2008" role="doc-biblioref">[3]</a></span>and cordiac image data <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-Schecklmann:BrainResearch2012" role="doc-biblioref">[4]</a></span>.
Nevertheless, PT 2 (psychosomatic suffering group) appears to match the “constant
distressing tinnitus” subgroup reported by Tyler et al. <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-Tyler:TinnitusClustering2008" role="doc-biblioref">[3]</a></span> because average scores tinnitus-related health burden were substantially greater than in the other subgroups.
Obviously, the selection of a meaningful set of features is pivotal for the efficacy of any cluster analysis.
<!-- Schlee et al. argued against the usage of single-item features  -->
<!-- like visual analogue scale measurements because of their higher susceptibility to  -->

<p>Closest to our radial bar chart visualization is the radar chart proposed by Schlee et al. <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-Schlee:RadarVis2017" role="doc-biblioref">[5]</a></span> whose solution is prone to overplotting when more than two subgroups need to be shown simultaneously.<br>
Hence, we did not fill up areas spanned by connected points with color, to
avoid a polygonal that fully overlays another one.
Further, inferences made on the radar chart <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-Schlee:RadarVis2017" role="doc-biblioref">[5]</a></span> are highly dependend on the ordering of features, since the main criterion for comparison the the polygonals’ shapes.
Their solution of computing an ordering that yields areas that achieve maximum mean surface difference between subgroups and minimum surface variance within subgroups only partially solves the problem, as still only a moderate number of up to ca. 20 features can be displayed.
We decided to arrange the 64 features based on expert-provided categories, e.g. quality of life which allows to find features and compare similar features easier.</p>
<p>Further, our visualization is tinnitus-specific but can be leveraged to show a compact summary of any condition or index symptoms subgroup.
Whether the visualizations will be adopted by clinicians for finding suitable tinnitus
management strategies needs to be tested.
In a preliminary user study, clinicians suggested that graphical summaries of possible patient subtypes may alleviate the challenge of allocating a suitable treatment strategy specific combinations of symptom presentations.</p>
<!-- % \todo{Müssen wir unsere Feature-Auswahl begründen?}\paragraph{Zitat aus Schlee et al. [@Schlee:RadarVis2017]:} \textcolor{red}{...One important consideration for the optimal use of this visualization method is the selection of measurement instruments. For example, single-item visual analog or numeric rating scales tend to be viewed as inferior because (i) they are more vulnerable to random measurement errors, which are more likely to be eliminated with multiple items, (ii) the reliability statistic ``internal consistency'' cannot be computed, and (iii) they are more vulnerable to unknown biases in meaning and interpretation....} -->
<p>There may be a selection bias due to the exlusion of patients who did not fill all questionnaires at T0.
Possible reasons for non-completion include unfamiliarity with the technical devices used to record item answers, loss of motivation due to the relatively large number of questionnaires and collision with other baseline examinations in the lab.
Nonetheless, the analysis of all 15 questionnaires led to insights into the
contributions of these questionnaires to phenotyping, so that eventually a reduction of questionnaires may become possible.
As our results reflect the snapshot of the patients’ situations only at baseline, a patient may transition from one phenotype to another in later stages of their life depending on tinnitus management.
Thus, a next step would be to study the effects of treatment to these phenotypes in more detail and find whether some patient phenotypes benefit more than others.</p>
