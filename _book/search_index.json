For example, epidemiologists aim to discover associations between multiple risk factors and an outcome in cohort studies collecting data which encompass rich information about the participants, gathered from questionnaires, medical examinations, laboratory analyses and image acquisition. Often, these data are repeatedly collected over time, for example in longitudinal studies. Thus, researchers incorporate a participants history in their analyses to account for temporal aspects. Finding associations between variables commonly requires medical scholars to first carefully derive some hypotheses from clinical daily routine, experimental studies or extensive literature research, and then formally test them on statistical significance. However, with the ever-growing volume and heterogeneity of medical data, traditional hypothesis-driven workflows become increasingly impractical because some important inherent associations between variables might remain undiscovered. Data Mining (DM) and Machine Learning1 (ML) can enhance medical research by discovering subpopulations of study participants which are similar with respect to the outcome, and thus can be used to derive new hypotheses. The proliferation of medical ML applications is triggered by multiple reasons, such as the desire of exploiting the plethora of gathered study participant information and the ubiquitousness of A.I. success stories in the media. However, simply building complex data-driven models does not guarantee that knowledge can be derived without effort. Most state-of-the-art ML algorithms such as deep neuronal networks and gradient boosting machines generate so called black-box models with multiple layers of complexity incorporating many multi-variate, non-linear interactions among variables, which are hard to present intuitively. It is vital that the application expert, which is not a practitioner, but a scholar working in a clinical or epidemiological environment, is equipped with means to understand, explore and visualize the models, so that s/he can drill down to specific individual patterns and gain actionable insights that ultimately contribute to prevention, diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Since health care data can be derived from diverse sources such as epidemiological studies or clinical trials, major characteristics of collected datasets vary which requires an adaption of methods tailored to the characteristics of the application scenario. The goal of this thesis is to support medical experts by providing an intelligent assistance for the analysis of high-dimensional temporal medical data. During the phases of model generation and model post-processing, several challenges have to be dealt with, so that the expert is able to derive actionable knowledge. These challenges translate to the following four demands: Interpretability of Patterns: patterns, i.e. clusters, rules, classification models, must be interpretable; the process of pattern generation must be interpretable. Exploitation of Time: time must be exploited, while satisfying requirement (1). Medical scholars search for long-term determinants of severe diseases. Finding patterns in the patient history and evolution can contribute to this aim. Minimization of Redundancy: redundancy must be minimized, while satisfying requirement (1). Patterns might be overlapping with respect to the subjects they cover. This leads to a redundancy of patterns which negatively affects the perceived quality of the model. One task is to minimize redundancy and deliver only a list of relevant patterns to the expert. Validation: validation must be part of the analysis, while satisfying (1), (2) and (3). There are several aspects to deal with: Dimensionality: to what extend can the same methods be used on low-dimensional and high-dimensional data? Time granularity: to what extend can the same methods be used on data with few discrete waves and with dense temporal recordings? The impact of the protocol: both data recorded for specific research questions (DIAB, Dan-Monica, IAD) are investigated as well as data recorded independently of the research questions (SHIP, CHA). To what extend can the same approaches be used, what deviations are needed? 1.2 Research Questions The motivation described in the previous section leads to the following research questions, including the core research question (RQ). The core research question of the thesis is: How to derive accurate yet understandable patterns for subpopulation discovery in high-dimensional temporal medical data? This question is central for the thesis. Since it includes multiple aspects, such as feature engineering, model learning, and post-mining steps, the question is subdivided into the following three research questions. RQ 1: How to leverage understandable models for high-dimensional temporal medical data? RQ 2: How to effectively capture and exploit implicit temporal information to improve model quality? RQ 3: How to extract, process and display the most relevant (temporal) patterns for expert-driven model exploration? Table 1.2 shows a mapping between scientific articles associated with this thesis and addressed research questions. 1.3 Epidemiological and Clinical Applications A categorization of temporal medical data. The structure of medical data naturally depends on the study design. In this thesis proposal, medical data is categorized using the following six criteria. Study type: epidemiological vs. clinical Number of variables: number of variables, features, attributes or dimensions Number of individuals: number of individuals, subjects, instances, patients or study participants Temporal horizon: timespan from first to last assessment Number of assessments over time: number of repeated assessments over time Temporal granularity: frequency of repeated assessments Table 1.1 juxtaposes the five application datasets with respect to the six criteria depicted above. E = epidemiological; C = clinical. Table 1.1: Study dataset characteristics.

NA We will evaluate our methods on five medical datasets. Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP). The Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) (VÃ¶lzke, Alte, Schmidt, Radke, and others 2011) encompasses two independent cohorts, SHIP-CORE and SHIP-TREND, consisting of participants aged from 20 to 79 years with main residency in the study region. Baseline examinations for SHIP-CORE were performed between 1997 and 2001 (SHIP-0, n=4308). Three follow-up examinations were conducted in intervals of 5 years, continuously adding new variables including MRI scans beginning from the second follow-up (SHIP-2). Baseline information for the SHIP-TREND (TREND-0, n=4420) was collected in 2008-2012. In both cohorts, a broad range of participant information was gathered, including socio-demographics, lifestyle and consumption behavior, medication intake, anthropometric values, blood and urine laboratory values, whole-body magnet resonance imaging, and others. The diabetic foot clinical study dataset (DFD). While SHIP investigates associations between risk factors of common diseases and health-related conditions in general, the diabetic foot clinical study (Niemann, Spiliopoulou, Szczepanski, et al. 2016; Niemann, Spiliopoulou, et al. 2020) investigates differences between diabetes patients diagnosed with severe polyneuropathy and healthy controls. In a pre-specified sequence of actions alternating between two postures, standing and sitting, custom-made sensor-bearing insoles placed in a closed shoe measured changes of a subjects plantar pressures and temperatures with high frequency over time. These measurements allowed for the analysis of pathophysiological and sensation-related differences between the two groups. The intracranial aneurysm angiography image dataset (IAD). The intracranial aneurysm angiography image dataset (AD) contains angiographical image data of 74 patients with a total of 100 intracranial aneurysms (Niemann et al. 2018). Intracranial aneurysms are pathologic dilations of the intracranial vessel wall, bearing the risk of rupture and thus subarachnoidal hemorrhages with often fatal consequences for the patient. Since treatment may cause severe complications as well, the goal is to generate models that can separate between ruptured and non-ruptured aneurysms. MONICA. This dataset is derived from the Danish population of the WHO project MONICA (Multinational MONItoring of trends and determinants in CArdiovascular disease). MONICA is a longitudinal epidemiological cohort study focusing on risk factors of cardio-vascular diseases, as well as causes and trends regarding the differences in the mortality between countries (Project 1989). Overall, 37 centers from 21 countries participated in the cohort study conducted between 1976 and 2002. Accomplishments of the project include the establishment of a profound database for prevention research and improvements on treatment of cardio-vascular diseases due to the identification of risk factors such as increased cholesterol and nicotine levels. In the Danish MONICA cohort, over 30,000 residents from the south-western of Copenhagen County, aged between 25 and 74 years, participated in three waves from 1982 to 1991 (BrÃ¸nnum-Hansen et al. 2001). The baseline examinations were conducted in 1982-1986 (DAN-MONICA I) with the first two follow-ups in 1986-1987 (DAN-MONICA II) and in 1991-1992 (DAN-MONICA III). The CharitÃ© tinnitus patients observational therapy study dataset (CHA). This dataset contains information on a cohort of a total of 3,971 tinnitus patients who had been treated at the Tinnitus Center of the CharitÃ© University Medicine in Berlin between January 2011 and October 2015. All patients had been suffering from tinnitus for 3 months or longer, were 18 years of age or older and had sufficient knowledge of the German language. At registration, patients were asked to complete 15 questionnaires on socio-demographics, tinnitus-related distress, frequency, loudness, localization and quality as well as physical and mental health status, including levels of depression and perceived stress. To assess efficacy of the treatment, patients filled the same battery of questionnaires a second time. 1.4 Structure and Summary of Contributions Contributions of the published and submitted work include a workflow and interactive application for data preparation, mining, and inspection of patterns for epidemiological data (Niemann, VÃ¶lzke, et al. 2014; Niemann, Spiliopoulou, et al. 2014a), a feature engineering framework for modeling and exploitation of the cohort participant evolution over time to improve classification quality (Niemann et al. 2015; Niemann, Hielscher, et al. 2020), a mechanism for feature extraction from raw multi-variate time-series to identify relevant subgroups in patients and healthy controls and (Niemann, Spiliopoulou, Samland, et al. 2016; Niemann, Spiliopoulou, Szczepanski, et al. 2016), a clustering-based algorithm that hierarchically reorganizes classification rule sets and summarizes all important concepts wihle maintaining diversity between the rule clusters to reduce pattern redundancy (Niemann et al. 2017), a pipeline for feature extraction, classification with post-mining functionalities such as feature ranking and inspection (Niemann et al. 2018), and results that confirm findings from medical literature or results that can be validated in independent studies.

Traditional data analysis pipelines are usually structured as follows: A medical scholar formulates a hypothesis based on observations in clinical practice or current research. Examples: how does a risk factor like alcohol abuse affects the prevalence of a certain outcome? Which effect does a novel therapy have on patients with depressive symptoms? To investigates this hypothesis, a small set of relevant variables is chosen, which might be controlled for confounders. Adequate data are collected. Variable selection may incorporate controlling for confounders. The strength of the associations between the selected variables and the outcome is assessed with regression models and statistical methods. Based on the results, inferential statistics are computed and conclusions are drawn which may foster the implementation of novel preventive measures or the application of suited treatment forms to high-risk patients. Primary medical research can be classified into basic, clinical and epidemiological studies. 2.2 Basic research Basic medical research (or experimental research) aims to improve understanding of cellular, molecular and physiological mechanisms of the human health and diseases by conducting cellular and molecular investigations, animal experiments, studies on drug and material properties in strictly controlled laboratory environments (RÃ¶hrig et al. 2009). To investigate (causal) effects of one or more variables of interest on the outcome, all other variables are usually kept constant and only those variables of interest are varied. The carefully standardized experimental conditions of basic medical studies ensure a high internal validity, but these conditions often cannot be easily transferred to clinical practice without a loss of generalizability of the results. !!! Basic research also includes the development and improvement of analytical (e.g., analytical determination of enzymes, markers, genes) and imaging measurement procedures (e.g., computer tomography, magnetic resonance tomography) as well as gene sequencing (e.g., the relationship between eye color and a specific gene sequence), and the development of biometric procedures such as statistical test procedures, modeling and statistical evaluation strategies. A brief overview of important medical study types is given (see also (Thiese 2014; RÃ¶hrig et al. 2009). 2.3 Clinical studies Clinical studies are generally classified into interventional (also: experimental) studies and non-interventional (also: observational) studies. The general goal of an interventional study is to compare different treatments within a patient population whose members differ as little as possible, except for the treatment branch. A common example is a pharmaceutical study which aims to validate the efficacy and harmlessness of a drug by investigating or establishing main and adverse effects, resorption, metabolization and excretion of the drug. Selection bias can be avoided by appropriate measures, in particular by randomly assigning patients to the groups. The treatment can be a drug, a surgical procedure or the therapeutic use of a medical product (e.g. stent), but also physiotherapy, acupuncture, psychosocial intervention, rehabilitation, training or diet. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) is considered as study design gold-standard as it minimizes selection bias a. by randomly allocating patients to treatment and control group, and b.by ensuring equal distribution of known and unknown influencing variables (confounders), such as risk factors, comorbidities and genetic variabilities. Thus, RCTs are suitable for obtaining an unambiguous answer to a clear question and proving causality. In contrast, non-interventional clinical studies are patient-related observational studies in which patients receive an individually defined therapy (or all patients receive the exact same therapy). Data analysis often takes place retrospectively. Observational studies are often used to generate hypotheses. - example: study that investigates the regular use of drugs in therapies the treatment, including diagnosis and monitoring, does not follow a pre-defined trial protocol, but only medical practice 2.3.0.1 prospective Prospective studies can be recognized by the chronological sequence of hypothesis generation and data collection. First, the hypotheses to be tested are determined, for example with respect to a new treatment procedure. Then, data are collected specifically for hypothesis testing. By formulating testable hypotheses first, it can be ensured that the research questions can actually be answered with the measured data. 2.3.0.2 retrospective data collection has already taken place before the start of the study examples: digitalized medical databases 2.4 Epidemiological studies TODO: Siehe Buch Epidemiological studies are usually interested in the distribution and temporal change of the frequency of diseases and their causes in the general population or in sub-populations. Analogous to clinical studies, epidemiology also distinguishes between experimental and observational studies. ??? A cross-sectional study (or prevalence study) is conducted only once whereas in a longitudinal study, the same study is carried out at several points in time and the results of the individual waves of investigation are compared. Longitudinal studies are further categorized into trend and panel design. In a trend study, each wave can involve a different participant sample, i.e., an individual participant is not followed over time. In contrast, a panel study investigates the same population at multiple points in time which allows to also measure intra-individual temporal changes. 2.4.0.1 controlled vs. uncontrolled epidemiological vs clinical vs experimental study what is a cohort samples (clinical samples, medical research samples) -&gt; validity? 2.5 Challenges heterogeneity (numeric, categorical) pre-processing of raw image data (non-tabular data) different requirements for different studies 2.6 Medical Applications 2.6.1 The Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) After the reunification of Germany, it was found that life expectancy was considerably lower in the east than in the west (VÃ¶lzke et al. 2015). Furthermore, there were regional differences within the former East Germany, with the lowest life expectancy in the northeast (VÃ¶lzke et al. 2015; Wiesner and Bittner 2004). To investigate the causal relationship between the high mortality in the northeastern German population and its risk factors, the research center for community medicine established the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) (VÃ¶lzke, Alte, Schmidt, Radke, and others 2011), a longitudinal epidemiological study of two independent cohorts in the northeast of Germany. SHIP attempts to describe a wide spectrum of health-related conditions rather than focusing on a specific target disease (VÃ¶lzke, Alte, Schmidt, Radke, and others 2011). In particular, major study goals comprise investigations regarding prevalence of common diseases and their risk factors, correlation and interaction between risk factors and diseases, progression from subclinical to manifest diseases, identification of subgroups with elevated health risk, prediction of incidental diseases, as well as utilization and costs of medical devices. TODO: shorten Cohort inclusion criteria were age from 20 to 79 years, main residency in the study region and German nationality. Participants of SHIP underwent an extensive, recurring (ca. every 5-6 years) examination program that encompasses personal interviews, body measurements, exercise electrocardiogram, laboratory analysis, ultrasound examinations and full body magnetic resonance tomography (MRT). Figure @ref:(fig:ship-sankey-plot) illustrates participant response and age distribution of show-ups across study waves. Baseline examinations for the first cohort were performed between 1997 and 2001 (SHIP-0, N=4308). Followup examinations were done in 2002-2006 (SHIP-1, n=3300), 2008-2012 (SHIP-2, n=2333), 2014-2016 (SHIP-3, n=1718) and since 2019 (SHIP-4). Baseline information for a second, independent cohort (SHIP-Trend-0, N=4420) was collected between 2008 and 2012 and a followup was conducted between 2016 and 2019. Major strengths of SHIP are a high level of quality assurance, standardized examination protocols, and a high cohort representativeness. Figure 2.1: Participation response and age distribution of show-ups across study waves of SHIP. Average population age is represented as black vertical line. The examination program changed across waves. For example, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was only conducted since SHIP-2; liver ultrasound was carried out in SHIP-0 and SHIP-2, but not in SHIP-1; dermatological examinations were conducted in SHIP-1 and SHIP-2, but not in SHIP-0. In our analyses, we focus on the disorder hepatic steatosis, also known as fatty liver, a condition which is characterized by a high accumulation of fat in the liver and present in ca. 30% of all adults (VÃ¶lzke, Alte, Schmidt, Radke, and others 2011; VÃ¶lzke et al. 2005). Risk factors include alcohol abuse, obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia (Antunes, Azadfard, and Gupta 2019). A liver biopsy is considered as diagnosis gold standard (Antunes, Azadfard, and Gupta 2019), but is associated with moderate risk for the patient. Non-invasive diagnosis forms include MRT, CT and ultrasound. Since hepatic steatosis is mostly asymptomatic, it often remains undiscovered which may develop into a more serious disease, such as steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, liver cell carcinoma or liver failure. 2.6.2 The Diabetic Foot Clinical Trial (DF) Diabetic foot syndrom is an umbrella term of foot-related problems in diabetes patients. Up to one out of four diabetes patients develop a foot ulcer during their lifetime (Boulton et al. 2005) with many of them facing amputations in the next four years (Kumari and Jagdish 2014). More than 85% of foot amputations relate to foot ulcers (Gregg et al. 2014; Volmer-Thole and Lobmann 2016). The rate of foot amputations among diabetic patients has been estimated to be 1740 times higher than in the general population (Fard, Esmaelzadeh, and Larijani 2007). DFS patients are predisposed to a peripheral sensoric neuropathy, which, for example, have the consequence that patients are unaware of the temperature of their feet, or the pressure they apply on them. Affected individuals may even injure themselves without noticing. Excessive plantar pressure loads may aggravate tissue destruction, increasing the lifetime risk of a foot ulceration (N. Singh, Armstrong, and Lipsky 2005). However, the understanding of the pathomechanisms underlying tissue destruction without trauma is limited. At the Medical Faculty of the Otto von Guericke University Magdeburg, an experimental study with 31 healthy volunteers and 30 diabetes patients diagnosed with severe polyneuropathy was conducted to quantify pressure- and posture-dependent changes of plantar temperatures as a surrogate of tissue perfusion. For this purpose, plantar pressure and temperature changes in the feet were recorded during extended phases of standing. Custom-made shoe insoles equipped with eight temperature sensors and eight pressure sensors at preselected positions were used for data acquisition (@ref(fig:02_df-infrared-sole-sensor-positions-plot) (a)). The insoles were positioned into closed protective shoes specifically developed for diabetes patients. Within such shoes the temperature increases over time due to exchange with the body temperature of the user and is also affected by the environmental temperature. To closely monitor the in-shoe temperature changes one sensor was placed at the bottom of the insole without contact to the feet, which was denoted ambient temperature sensor. (#fig:02_df-infrared-sole-sensor-positions-plot)(a) Sensor positioning in relation to foot placement. (b) Infrared images of a healthy volunteer in a seated position without pressure application to the feet (before) and following positioning of a 20 kg weight on both upper thighs. A time-dependent decrease of temperature was detected predominantly in the forefoot, visualized by yellow color during the pressure load. Within 1 min of pressure release, a rapid temperature rise was detected. The data acquisition started immediately after putting on the shoes. The participants were asked to follow a predefined sequence of actions, that are alternating postures of standing (stance phase) and seating (pause). The sessions consisted of six stance episodes, lasting 5, 10, 20, 5, 10 and 20 minutes each, separated by seating episodes lasting 5 min each. The participants were instructed to apply pressure equally on both feet while standing. Participants did not receive immediate feedback of the actual pressure application during the sessions, however study nurses verbally encouraged to keep the pressure without release while standing. In the seated position the participants were instructed to release pressure for 5 minutes, while still keeping contact to the insole. The participants were explicitly asked to adhere to these instructions, e.g. they should not temporarily release pressure during a stance episode. The study protocol furthermore encompassed that the measurements were performed twice, once at room temperature of ca 22Â°C and once outdoors with an ambient temperature of ca. 16Â°C. The two measurements were performed on two independent days. The termographic images in Figure @ref(fig:02_df-infrared-sole-sensor-positions-plot) (b) exemplarily visualize changes of plantar temperature, for a healthy volunteer in a seated position, before pressure application (1), after placement of a 20 kg weight on the front of the upper thighs (2-6), and after removal of the additional weight (7-8). During pressure load, a gradual temporal temperature decrease was detected predominantly in the forefoot. After pressure release, a rapid temperature rise within 1 min was observed. 2.6.3 The Intracranial Aneurysm Angiography Image Dataset (IAD) Retrospective clinical Intracranial aneurysms are pathologic dilations of the intracranial vessel wall, often in form of a dilation. They bear a a risk of rupture which then lead to subarachnoidal hemorrhages with often fatal consequences for the patient. Since treatment can also cause severe complications, extensive studies were conducted to assess the patient-individual rupture risk based on various parameters, including aneurysm symptomatology, size and location, as well as patient age and gender (Wermer et al. 2007). Further studies identified parameters, such as aspect ratio, undulation index and nonsphericity index as statistically significant with respect to aneurysm rupture status (Dhar et al. 2008; Xiang et al. 2011). However, although these studies allow for a retrospective analysis, the clinician needs further guidance in case an asymptomatic aneurysm (as accidental finding) was detected and the rupture risk should be determined. We developed methods for the Intracranial Aneurysm Angiography Image Dataset (IAD) comprising 3D rotational angiography data from 74 patients (age: 33-85 years, 17 male and 57 female patients) of the university hospital of Magdeburg, Germany, adding up to a total of 100 intracranial aneurysms. Aneurysms and vessels are segmented with a threshold-based approach (GlaÃer et al. 2015) from digital subtraction data. Afterwards, the vessels centerline were extracted with the vascular modeling toolkit (VMTK, vmtk.org) (Antiga et al. 2008). The aneurysms were delineated from the parent vessel using the automatic ostim detection of Saalfeld et al. (Saalfeld et al. 2018, to appear). The primary goal of the study is to determine how accurately the rupture status of an aneurysm can be determined with classification models based on morphological parameters that are available to the clinician. 2.6.4 The Tinnitus Patients Observational Therapy Study Dataset (CHA) Tinnitus is the perception of a phantom sound in absence of an external sound source. It is a complex multi-factorially caused and maintained phenomenon, and estimated to affect between 10% and 15% of the adult population (Baguley, McFerran, and Hall 2013). The associated annual economic burden amounts to US$19.4 billion in the United States (Bhatt, Bhattacharyya, and Lin 2017) and 6.8 billion in the Netherlands alone (Maes et al. 2013). Clinical assessment of tinnitus is challenging due patient heterogeneities with respect to perception of tinnitus (laterality, pitch, sound characteristics, frequency, permanence, chronicity), risk factors (including hearing loss, temporomandibular joint disorder, aging), comorbidities (including hyperacusis, depression, sleep disorders), perceived distress, and treatment response (Cederroth et al. 2019). These differences make the identification of a suitable and effective form of treatment difficult. Currently, there does not exist a therapy gold standard: sound therapy (masking), informational counseling (minimal contact education), cognitive behavioral therapy and tinnitus retraining were found to be effective for some patients, but there is also evidence that not all patients benefit equally from these treatment forms (Hobson, Chisholm, and El Refaie 2012; KrÃ¶ner-Herwig et al. 2003; Henry and Wilson 1996; Martinez-Devesa et al. 2007; Phillips and McFerran 2010). Due to the heterogeneous nature of the tinnitus symptom as well as the unclear evidence-base as to its treatment and management, the identification of patient subgroups is vital to stratify individual pathophysiology and treatment pathways (Langguth et al. 2017; Tyler et al. 2008; Landgrebe et al. 2010). The tinnitus patients observational therapy study dataset (CHA) comprises self-report data from 4,103 tinnitus patients who had been treated at the Tinnitus Center of CharitÃ© University Medicine Berlin between January 2011 and October 2015. All patients were 18 years of age or older and had been suffering from tinnitus for at least 3 months. Exclusion criteria were presence of acute psychotic illness or addiction disorder, deafness and insufficient knowledge of the German language. Treatment comprised a multimodal 7-day program that included intensive and daily informational counseling, detailed ear-nose-throat as well as psychological diagnostics, cognitive behavior therapy interventions, hearing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation and physiotherapy. At baseline (T0; before therapy commencement) and after treatment (T1), patients were asked to complete multiple self-report questionnaires. These questionnaires were selected to obtain a comprehensive tinnitus assessment, including tinnitus-related distress and the psychosomatic background of tinnitus with anxiety, depression, general quality of life and experienced physical impairments. Table @ref(tab:cha_questionnaires) provides an overview of all questionnaires used in the analysis. Most questionnaires contain multiple-choice items with answers on a Likert scale. For example, the TQ contains 52 statements, such as I am unable to enjoy listening to music because of the noises. and respondents can give 3 possible answers: not true (encoded as 0), partly true (1) and true (2). Some questionnaires also comprise aggregated variables, called subscales and total scores. For example, the TQ total score (TQ_distress) is calculated as sum of 40 item values, where 2 items are used twice (Gerhard Goebel and Hiller 1998), yielding a value range from 0 to 84, where higher values represent higher tinnitus-related distress. The cutoff value 46 (Gerhard Goebel and Hiller 1998) is used to distinguish between compensated (0-46) and decompensated (47-84) tinnitus. Further, for each questionnaire, the average time to answer an item was recorded. Figure @ref:(fig:cha-patient-demographics-plot) provides a graphical illustration of demographics for 3,803 (92.7%) patients with complete data for the SOZ questionnaire and TQ score.

Our goal is to identify compact subpopulations that are as pure as possible with respect to the target variable. 3.1 Motivation and Comparison with Related Work Medical decisions on diagnosis and treatment of multifactorial conditions such as diseases and disorders are based on clinical and epidemiological studies; the latter accommodate information on participants with and without a condition and allow for learning discriminative models and, in the longitudinal design, for understanding the progress of the condition. For example, several studies identified risk factors (like obesity or alcohol consumption) and co-morbidities (like cardiovascular diseases) associated with hepatic steatosis (fatty liver) (Ittermann et al. 2012; Lau et al. 2010; Stickel et al. 2011; Targher, Day, and Bonora 2010; Markus et al. 2013). However, these studies identified risk factors and associated outcomes that pertain to the whole population. Our work originated from the necessity to identify such factors and outcomes for subpopulations and thus to promote personalized diagnosis and treatment, as expected in personalized medicine (Hingorani et al. 2013; VÃ¶lzke et al. 2013). Classification on subpopulations was studied by Zhanga and Kodell (Zhanga and Kodell 2013) who pointed out that classifier performance on the whole dataset can be low if the complete population is very heterogeneous. Therefore, they first trained an ensemble of classifiers, and then used the predictions of each ensemble member to create a new feature space. They performed hierarchical clustering to partitioned the instances into three subpopulations: one where the prediction accuracy is high, one where it is intermediate and one where it is low. With this approach, Zhanga and Kodell split the original dataset into subpopulations that are easy or difficult to classify. While the method seems appealing in general, it appeared unsuitable for the three-class problem of the SHIP data which exhibits a very skewed distribution, hence it is clear that low classification accuracy is (partially) caused by the skew. Hence, we studied the dataset exploratively before classification, to identify less skewed subpopulations, and exploratively after classification, to identify - inside each subpopulation - variables which are highly associated to the outcome. Pinheiro et al. performed association rule discovery on patients with liver carcinoma (Pinheiro et al. 2013). The authors pointed out that early detection of liver cancer may help reducing the five-year mortality rate, but early detection is difficult, because in the onset of a liver carcinoma, the patient often observes no symptoms (Pinheiro et al. 2013). Pinheiro et al. leveraged the association rule algorithm FP-growth (Han, Pei, and Yin 2000) to discover high-confidence association rules and high-confidence classification rules regarding mortality in liver cancer patients. We also considered association rules promising for the analysis of medical data, because they are easy to compute and deliver results that are understandable by humans. Therefore, we also used association rules as baseline method, though for epidemiological data and for classification rather than mortality prediction. To use association rules for classification, we specified that the rule consequent is the target variable. Zhang et al. (Zhang, Gotz, and Perer 2015) addressed the increasing technical challenges of medical expert-driven subpopulation discovery due to increasingly large and complex medical data which often comprise information of hundrets of variables for thousands of patients in form of tables, images or text. Whereas in the past it was sufficient for a physician to have working knowledge of basic statistics and a spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel to analyze a small table with patient data, nowadays more effective and efficient approaches are required for management, analysis and summarization of very large medical data. As a result, domain experts usually rely on technical experts to help them perform these tasks. However, this back and forth process is often slow, tedious and expensive. Hence, it would be better to equip the domain expert with a technical tool that allows them to quickly perform exploratory analyses on their own. Zhang et al. (Zhang, Gotz, and Perer 2015) presented CAVA, a system that incorporates miscellaneous subgroup visualizations (called Views) and analytic components (called Analytics) for subgroup comparison. The main panel in Figure 3.1 shows one of the Views: a flow diagram (Wongsuphasawat and Gotz 2012) of patient subgroups with the same sequence of symptoms. Users can obtain additional summaries by interacting with the visualization, e.g. by placing one of the boxes in the flow diagram onto one of the entries in the Analytics panel via drag-and-drop. Further, user can expand the selected cohort by letting the tool search patients who do not strictly match the current inclusion criteria but are somewhat similar to the current patient subpopulation (Ebadollahi et al. 2010). Figure 3.1: CAVAs graphical user interface. The flow chart visualizes cardiac patient subgroups organized by shared symptom occurrence. Color represents hospitalization risk. The user can switch between graphical representations and data processing methods via drag-and-drop operations. The top-right panel provides detailed information for the currently selected patients. The bottom-right panel contains a provenance graph that allows the user to undo operations and to revisit previous interaction steps. (from: (Zhang, Gotz, and Perer 2015)) Krause et al. (Krause, Perer, and Ng 2016) argued that model selection should not be based solely on global performance metrics like accuracy, because these statistics do not contribute to a better understanding of the models reasoning. Furthermore, a complex yet very accurate model does not automatically warrant actionable insights. Krause et al. propose Prospector (Krause, Perer, and Ng 2016), a system that provides diagnostic components for complex classification models based on the concepts of partial dependence (PD) plots (Friedman 2001). PD plots are a popular tool to visualize the marginal effect of a feature on the predicted outcome probability. Briefly, each point of a PD curve represents the average prediction of the model over all observations, given that these observations had a fixed value for a feature of interest. A feature whose PD curve has a high range or variability is considered to be more impactful to the model prediction than a feature with a flat PD curve. Closely related to PD plots are individual conditional expectation (ICE) plots (Goldstein et al. 2015), which display one curve for every observation, and thus help to uncover contrasting subpopulations who might average out in a PD plot. Prospector combines PD and ICE curves to depict the relationship between a feature and the model prediction on a (global) model level and a (local) patient-individual level. Further, a color bar is provided as more compact alternative to ICE curves (Figure 3.2) (a). A stacked bar chart shows the distribution of predicted risk scores for each study group (Figure 3.2 (b)), and the user can click on a specific decile to get a list of individual patients with their exact prediciton score and label. In this way, patients whose prediction score is close to the decision boundary can be further investigated. The authors calculate for each feature the most impactful feature change: given the actual feature value of a patient, they identify a near counterfactual value that led to a large change in the predicted risk score, by minimizing difference to the original feature value and maximizing predicted risk score. The top-5 of these so called suggested changes are displayed  separately for inreasing and decreasing disease risk  in a table (cf. Figure 3.2 (c)), and incorporated as interactive elements into the IC color bars (cf. Figure 3.2 (d)). Figure 3.2: A selection of Prospectors model diagnostics. (a) The upper chart depicts two curves for the feature age: the gray partial dependence (PD) curve represents the marginal prediction of the model over all patients whereas the black individual conditional expectation (ICE) curve illustrates the effect of counterfactual age values on the predicted diabetes risk for an example patient. The histogram shows the age distribution. The color bar placed beneath is a compact depiction of the ICE curve above; the encircled value represents the feature value of the selected patient. (b) Stacked bars show the distribution of predicted risk scores for each study group. Clicking on one of the bars opens a table that shows ID, predicted risk and true label for all patients belonging to the selected prediction risk decile. (c) Summary table of the most impactful feature changes for decreasing (upper group) and increasing (lower group) predicted risk: each row shows the actual feature value and the suggested change, i.e., a similar but counterfactual value that led to a considerable change in predicted risk.

(Pahins et al. 2019) presented COVIZ, a system for cohort construction in large spatiotemporal datasets. COVIZ comprises mechanisms for explorative data analysis of treatment pathways and event trajectories, visual cohort comparison and visual querying. One of COVIZ design goals is being fast, e.g. by using efficient data structures like Quantile Data Structure (Lara Pahins, Ferreira, and Comba 2019) to ensure low latency for all computational operations and hence suitablity for large datasets. Bernard et al. (Bernard et al. 2015) proposed a system for cohort construction in temporal prostate cancer cohort data which comprised visualizations for both subgroups and individual patients. To guide users during exploration, visual markers indicate interesting relationships between attributes derived from statistical tests. 3.1.1 Other related work IIComPath: (Corvo et al. 2020) 3.1.2 Previous Work on SHIP Klemm et al. (Klemm et al. 2015) presented a 3D regression cube system which enables interactive exploration of feature correlations in epidemiological datasets. The system generates a large number of multiple regression models from various combinations of one dependent and two independent variables and displays their goodness of fit in a three-dimensional heatmap. The system allows the user to modify the regression equation, for example, by changing the number of independent variables, by specifying interaction terms or by fixing one of the variables to reduce computational complexity or to specifically focus on a variable of interest. Our approach is also capable of identifying variables that are highly associated with the outcome, but we search for subpopulation-specific relationships instead of generating a global model for the whole dataset, and we further provide predictive value ranges. Klemm et al. (Klemm et al. 2014) presented a system which combines visual representations of non-image and image data. They identify clusters of backpain patients on the SHIP data. As we fixed hepatic steatosis as outcome, we rather opted to build supervised models and classification rules that directly captured the relationships between predictive variables and the outcome. Alemzadeh et al. (Alemzadeh et al. 2017) presented S-ADVIsED, a system for interactive exploration of subspace clusters, incorporating various visualization types, such as donut charts, correlation heatmaps, scatterplot matrices, mosaic charts and error bar graphs. While S-ADVIsED requires the user to input the mining results obtained in advance outside of the system, our tool allows for an expert-driven interactive subpopulation discovery. Hielscher et al. (Hielscher et al. 2016) developed a semi-supervised constrained-based subspace clustering algorithm to find diverse sets of interesting feature subsets using the SHIP data. To guide the search for interesting feature subsets, the expert can provide their domain knowledge in form of instance-level constraints, thus forcing pairs of instances to be assigned either to the same or a different cluster. Hielscher et al. (Hielscher et al. 2018) extended their work and introduced a mechanism to compare subpopulations between independent cohorts. As a consequence, thesame group developed a constrained-based technique, where theclustering is guided by a small set of constraints, given by an expert[HNP*18]. As an example, for a few pairs of participants diagnosedwith fatty liver, the expert specifies that these participants must be inthe same clusters, whereas some other pairs of participants are forcedto be in different clusters since one in each pair is diagnosed withthe disorder and the other is not. This semi-supervised subspaceclustering turned out to yield relevant results for epidemiologists[HNP*18]. TODO: Preim: Visual analytics of image-centric cohort studies in epidemiology 3.2 Subpopulation Discovery Workflow and Interactive Mining Assistant Our subpopulation discovery workflow is presented hereafter. The dataset used for population partitioning and class sepration on the target variable hepatic steatosis come from the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) which is described in Subsection 2.6.1. In subsection 3.2.1, explains origin and availability of the target variable. In subsection 3.2.2, the motivation for partitioning of the data and the partitioning steps are presented. Then, the used methods for class separation on the whole dataset and on the partitions are discussed in Subsection 3.2.3. 3.2.1 Target variable The target variable is derived from the participants liver fat concentration computed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). At the time of writing the original manuscript, MRI results were available only for 578 SHIP-2 participants. We use the data of these participants for classifier learning, while our interactive (cf. section ???) also juxtaposes these data to the data of the remaining 1755 participants, for whom the MRI recordings were not made available. Participants with a liver fat concentration of 10% or less are mapped to class A (negative class, i.e., absence of the disorder), values greater than 10% and lower than 25% are mapped to class B (increased liver fat / fatty liver tendency), and values greater than 25% are mapped to class C (high liver fat). We consider classes B and C as positive. Although the cut-off value of 10% is higher than the value of 5% suggested by (KÃ¼hn et al. 2011) for separation between subjects with and without hepatic steatosis. However, the primary interest from the medical perspective was the identification of important variables for individuals that are likely to be ill. The selection of a high cut-off value exacerbated class imbalance and made the data analysis more challenging. Figure 3.3 depicts the class distribution by gender. Out of the 578 participants, 438 belong to class A (ca. 76%), 108 to B (ca. 19%) and 32 to C (ca. 6%). Men are more likely to exhibit increased or high liver fat than women (30.7% vs. 18.8% in classes B or C). Figure 3.3: Gender-specific distribution of the target variable. Next to the target variable, the dataset contains 66 variables extracted from participants questionnaire answers and medical tests (cf. (VÃ¶lzke, Alte, Schmidt, Radke, Lorbeer, et al. 2011)). They are variables on sociodemographics (gender, age, etc.), variables on consumption behaviour (e.g. alcohol and cigarettes), SNPs (genetic information), variables extracted from laboratory data (e.g. sera concentrations), and two variables on the results of the liver ultrasound  stea_s2 and stea_alt75_s2. Both variables take symbolic values that reflect the likelihood that the participant has fatty liver; the latter is a combination of the former and the ALAT recording for the participant; details are in (cf. (VÃ¶lzke, Alte, Schmidt, Radke, Lorbeer, et al. 2011)). Almost all variables mentioned hereafter have the suffix _s2 which indicates measurements of the SHIP-2 followup, as opposed to SHIP-0 (_s0) and SHIP-1 (_s1). Exceptions are gender, highest school degree and the 10 SNP variables. 3.2.2 Partitioning the Dataset into Subpopulations Since the dataset is imbalanced with respect to gender (314 women, 264 men), we decided to partition the dataset before classification. First, we investigated the class distributions in the two partitions on gender. We observed that the distributions are very different, most notably with respect to class B (cf. Figure @(fig:03-fatty-liver-mosaic). As second step, we studied the class distribution by gender and age, whereupon we detected that age is associated with PartitionF but not with PartitionM. Third, we identified a cut-off point for age by introducing a heuristic that identifies the age value which minimizes the standard deviation with respect to the target variable. Afterwards, we performed supervised learning separately on the partitions of male and female participants. Furthermore, we built an additional learner for the subpopulation of older female participants aged above the cut-off point 52. To understand how age affects the class distribution, we introduced a heuristic that determines the cutoff age value at which partitionF splits into two bins, so that the standard deviations of the liver fat concentration in each bin are minimized. Let \\(\\mathsf{splitAge}\\) denote the cutoff value and \\(X_y=\\{x\\in\\mathsf{PartitionF}|\\text{age of } x \\leq \\mathsf{splitAge}\\}\\), \\(X_z=\\{x\\in\\mathsf{PartitionF}|\\text{age of } x &gt; \\mathsf{splitAge}\\}\\) denote the bins. Further, let \\(n\\) be the cardinality of \\(X_y\\cup{}X_z\\) i.e. of PartitionF. Then, we define the Sum of weighted Standard Deviations (\\(SwSD\\)) as \\[ SwSD\\left(X_y,X_z\\right) = \\frac{|X_y|}{n}\\sigma({X_y})+\\frac{|X_z|}{n}\\sigma({X_z}) \\tag{3.1} \\] where \\(|X_i|\\) is the cardinality of \\(X_i\\) and \\(\\sigma(X_i)\\) the standard deviation of the original liver fat values. Our heuristic selects the \\(\\mathsf{splitAge}\\) such that \\(SwSD\\) is minimal. For \\(\\mathsf{PartitionF}\\), the minimum value was 7.44 at the age of 52, i.e. close to the onset of menopause. Figure 3.4: Distribution of liver fat concentration in male participants, and in female younger and older than 52 years. The horizontal axis shows the liver fat concentration in bins of 5%, while the vertical axis shows the number of participants in each bin. The histograms in Figure 3.4 depict the differences in the liver fat concentration distributions at the age cutoff value of 52. Next to \\(\\mathsf{PartitionM}\\) (n=264), we show the subpartitions \\(\\mathsf{F:age\\leq{}52}\\) (n=131) and \\(\\mathsf{F:age&gt;52}\\) (n=183) of \\(\\mathsf{PartitionF}\\). Most of female participants in \\(\\mathsf{F:age\\leq{}52}\\) have no more than 5% liver fat concentration and ca. 95% have no more than 10%, i.e., they belong to the negative class A. In contrast, ca. 28% of the participants in \\(\\mathsf{F:age&gt;52}\\) have a liver fat concentration of more than 10%; they belong to the positive classes B and C. For the classification of the cohort participants we concentrated on algorithms that deliver interpretable models, since we wanted to identify predictive conditions, i.e., variables and values/ranges in the models. Hence, we considered decision trees, classification rules and regression trees. We employed the J4.8 decision tree classification algorithm (equivalent to the C4.5 algorithm (Quinlan 1992)) of the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (Weka) workbench (Frank, Hall, and Witten 2016). This algorithm builds a tree successively, by splitting each node (subset of the dataset) on the variable that maximizes information gain within that node. The original algorithm operates only on variables that take categorical values and creates one child node per value. However, the implementation in the Weka library also provides an option that forces the algorithm to always create exactly two child nodes: one for the best separating value and one for all other values. We used this option in our experiments, because it delivers trees of better quality. Moreover, the Weka algorithm also supports variables that take numeric values: a node is split into two child nodes by partitioning the value range of the variable into two intervals. To deal with the skewed distribution, we considered the following classification variants: Naive: the problem of imbalanced data is ignored. InfoGain: we keep only the top-30 of the 66 variables, by sorting the variables on information gain towards the target variable. Oversampling: We use SMOTE (Chawla et al. 2002) to resample the dataset with minority-oversampling: for class B, 100% new instances are generated, for class C 300% new instances are generated, resulting in following distribution A:438, B:216, C:128. CostMatrix: We prefered to misclassify a negative case rather than not detecting a positive case, so we penalized false negatives (FN) more than false positives (FP). We used the cost matrix depicted in Table 3.1. Table: (#tab:03-costmatrix) Cost matrix penalizing misclassification under class skew. Predicted class A B C True class A 0 1 2 B 2 0 1 C 3 2 0 % % Regression % We learn regression trees on the original continuous target variable using the Weka algorithms REPTree (Error Pruning Tree), M5P and MP5Rules. 3.2.3 Classification Rule Discovery Classification rules can uncover interesting relationships between one or more features and the outcome (FÃ¼rnkranz, Gamberger, and Lavra 2012; Herrera et al. 2011). Compared to model families such as deep neural networks, support vector machines and random forests, classification rules achieve inferior accuracy most of the time. However, they are easier to interpret and reason about, and hence lend themselves better for interactive subpopulation discovery. In epidemiological research, interesting subpopulations could be subsequently used to formulate and validate a small set of hypotheses or just to explore associations between risk factors for a specific outcome. An interesting subpopulation could be phrased as In the sample of this study, the prevalence of goiter is 32%, while the likelihood in the subpopulation described by thyroid-stimulating hormone smaller equal 1.63 mU/l and body mass index greater than 32.5 kg/m2 is 49%. Classification rule algorithms induce descriptions of ``interesting subpopulations of the data where interestingness is quantified by a quality function. A classification rule is an association rule whose consequent is fixed to a specific class value. Consider the exemplary classification rule \\(r_1\\): \\[ r_1: \\underbrace{\\text{som_waist_s2} &lt; 80 \\wedge \\text{age_ship_s2} &gt; 59 \\left(\\wedge \\ldots \\right)}_{\\text{Antecedent}} \\longrightarrow \\underbrace{\\vphantom{\\text{som_waist_s2} &lt; 80 \\wedge \\text{age_ship_s2} &gt; 59 \\left(\\wedge \\ldots \\right)}\\text{hepatic_steatosis = pos}}_{\\text{Consequent}} \\tag{3.2} \\] Underpinnings Classification rules are expressed in the form of \\(r: \\text{antecedent} \\longrightarrow T=v\\). The conjunction of conditions (i.e. feature - feature value pairs) left to the arrow constitutes the rules \\(\\text{antecedent}\\) (or left hand site). In the \\(\\text{consequent}\\) (or right hand side), \\(v\\) is the requested value for the target variable \\(T\\). We define \\(s(r)\\) as the subpopulation or cover set of \\(r\\), i.e. the set of instances that satisfy the antecedent of \\(r\\). The coverage of \\(r\\), which is the fraction of instances covered by \\(r\\), is then defined as \\(Cov(r)=|s(r)|/N\\), where \\(N\\) is the total number of instances. The support of \\(r\\) quantifies the percentage of instances covered by \\(r\\) that additionally have \\(T=v\\), calculated as \\(Sup(r)=|s(r)_{T=v}|/N\\). The confidence of \\(r\\) (also referred to as precision or accuracy) is defined as \\(Conf(r)= |s(r)_{T=v}|/|s(r)|\\) and expresses the relative frequency of instances satisfying the complete rule (i.e., both the antecedent and the consequent) among those satisfying only the antecedent. The recall or sensitivity of \\(r\\) with respect to \\(T=v\\) is defined as \\(Recall(r)=Sensitivity(r)=\\frac{|s(r)_{T=v}|}{n_{T=v}}\\). The Weighted Relative Accuracy of a rule is an interestingness measure which balances coverage and confidence gain and is often used as internal quality criterion for candidate generation (Herrera et al. 2011). It is defined as \\(WRAcc(r) = Cov(r)\\cdot \\left(Conf(r)-\\frac{n_{T=v}}{N} \\right)\\). As an example, Figure 3.5 illustrates an exemplary rule \\(r_2\\) in a dataset with 10 instances and a binary target, where circles in cyan color represent instances from the negative class and red circles are positive instances. The cover set of \\(r_2\\) contains instances 7, 8, 9 and 10, hence \\(Cov(r_2)=0.40\\). Further, \\(Sup(r_2)=0.30\\), \\(Conf(r_2)=0.75\\) and \\(WRAcc(r_2)=0.4\\cdot\\left(0.75-0.4\\right)=0.14\\). Figure 3.5: Exemplary classification rule. 3.2.4 HotSpot For classification rule discovery we use the algorithm HotSpot2 provided in the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analyis (WEKA) workbench (Frank, Hall, and Witten 2016). HotSpot is a beam search algorithm that implements a general-to-specific approach for extracting rules. A single rule is constructed by successively adding the condition to the antecedent that locally maximizes confidence. Contrary to general hill-climbing which considers only the best rule candidate at each iteration, HotSpots beam search keeps the \\(b\\) highest ranked candidates and refines them in later steps. Consequently, HotSpot reduces the myopia (FÃ¼rnkranz, Gamberger, and Lavra 2012) hill-climbing search typically suffers from. Briefly, hill-climbing approaches consider only the locally optimal candidate at each iteration. As a consequence a globally optimal rule is not found if it is not locally optimal in every iteration. From an application point of view, it is also desirable to generate more than one rule, as alternative descriptions of subpopulations can facilitate hypothesis generation. The beam width can be specified as maximum branching factor, the maximum number of conditions that may be added to a rule candidate. In every iteration, rule candidates must satisfy the minimum value count which is the sensitivity threshold. To avoid adding a condition that leads only to a marginal improvement in confidence, the parameter minimum improvement, i.e. the minimum relative improvement in confidence by adding a further condition can be specified. Computational complexity of the rule search can be reduced by specifying a maximum rule length, which is the number of conditions in the antecedent. describe parametrization in experiments 3.2.5 Interactive Medical Miner Classification rules can provide valuable insights on potentially prevalent conditions for different subpopulations of the cohort under study. However, if the number of rules produced is large, as it is usually the case in large epidemiological data, the conditions of the rules overlap and some conditions are present under each of the target features classes. Hence, the medical expert needs inspection aids to decide which rules are informative and which features should be studied further. Our Interactive Medical Miner (IMM) allows the expert to (a) discover classification rules subject to frequency constraints, inspect the frequency of those rules (b) towards each class and (c) against the unlabeled part of the cohort, and (d) study the statistics of each rule for the values of selected variables. We describe these functionalities below, referring to the screenshot in Figure @ref(fig:03_imm-modified). (ref:03_imm-modified) The Interactive Medical Miner: classification rules are discovered for class B and shown in the bottom left panel. For the selected rule \\(\\text{som_huef_s2 &gt; 109 &amp; crea_u_s2 &gt; 5.38} \\longrightarrow \\text{mrt_liverfat_s2 = B}\\), the distribution of the participants covered by the rule among all three classes is shown in absolute values (top middle panel) and as histogram (bottom right panel) with respect to age (top right panel). (#fig:03_imm-modified)(ref:03_imm-modified) The user interface consists of six panels. The Settings panel (upper left) allows the medical expert to set the parameters for rule induction before pressing the button Build Rules. Below this panel, the discovered rules are displayed. The panel Sorting preference allows the expert to specify whether rules should be sorted by confidence, by coverage, or rather alphabetically for better overview of overlapping rules. The mining criteria include the dataset (choosing between the whole dataset versus one of the partitions), the class for which rules should be generated (drop-down list Class) and the constraints with respect to this class, i.e., min value count (which can also be given as relative number), maximum rule length, maximum branching factor and minimum improvement. As an example how these parameters affect the rule search, consider the selected rule in Figure xxx, \\(\\text{som_huef_s2 &gt; 109 &amp; crea_u_s2 &gt; 5.38} \\longrightarrow \\text{mrt_liverfat_s2 = B}\\), which has a coverage of 0.12 and a confidence of 0.56. The sensitivity of \\(38/108=0.352\\) satisfies the minimum value count threshold of 0.33. From the Apriori property, it is apparent that each of the two conditions in the rules antecedent, namely \\(\\text{som_huef_s2 &gt; 109}\\) and \\(\\text{crea_u_s2 &gt; 5.38}\\) must also exceed this threshold. The position of a condition within the antecedent indicates at which refinment step it was added to the rule candidate. For example, the first condition \\(\\text{som_huef_s2 &gt; 109}\\) with a confidence of \\(44/107=0.41\\) was expanded by the second condition \\(\\text{crea_u_s2 &gt; 5.38}\\), because the gain in confidence exceeds the minimum improvement threshold, i.e., \\(38/68 - 44/107 = 0.15 &gt; 0.05\\). This rule, however, cannot be further expanded because the maximum rule length is set to 2. The maximum branching factor was set conservatively to 1000, to prevent potentially interesting rules from not being generated due to small beam width. The parameter can be lowered interactively, if the number of discovered rules is to high or rule induction takes too long. The output list of an execution run (area below the Settings) is scrollable and interactive. When the expert clicks on a rule, the top middle area Summary Statistics is updated. The first row shows the distribution of the cohort participants among the classes for the whole dataset, while the second row shows how the participants covered by the rule (column Total in the second row) are distributed among the classes. Hence, the expert can specify the discovery of classification rules for one of the classes and then study how often the antecedent of each rule appears among the participants in the other classes. A rule that covers most of the participants of the selected class (class B in Figure @ref(fig:03_imm-modified)) is not necessarly interesting, for example, if it covers also a high number of participants of the other classes. The rule \\(\\text{som_huef_s2 &gt; 109 &amp; crea_u_s2 &gt; 5.38} \\longrightarrow \\text{mrt_liverfat_s2 = B}\\) covers 68 participants in total, 38 of them having class B. To lower the number of covered participants from other classes , i.e., to increase confidence, the user can lower the minimum value count, to allow for the generation of rules with lower sensitivity, but more homogeneity with respect to the selected class. Some of the data might be incomplete. For example, not all participants in the cohort have been subjected to liver MRI. Hence, it is also of interest to know the distribution of the unlabeled participants who support the antecedent of a given rule. The Histogram panel can be used to this purpose: the expert chooses a further feature from the interactive area Variable selection in the upper right panel and can then see how the values of these variable are distributed among the study participants - both the labeled ones and the unlabeled ones; the latter are marked as Missing in the color legend. For plotting the histograms we make use of the free Java chart library JFreeChart . Numeric variables are discretized using Scotts rule (Scott 1979) as follows: let \\(X_{s(r)}\\) be the set of values for a numeric variable \\(X\\) with respect to the cover set \\(s(r)\\). The bin width \\(h\\) is then calculated as \\(h(X_{s(r)})=\\frac{\\max{X_{s(r)}}-\\min{X_{s(r)}}}{3.49\\text{sd}_{s(r)}}\\cdot |s(r)|^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\). If the expert does not choose any variable, the target variable is used by default, and only the distribution of the labeled participants is visible. The histogram in Figure @ref(fig:03_imm-modified) shows the age distribution of both labeled and unlabeled participants covered by our example rule \\(\\text{som_huef_s2 &gt; 109 &amp; crea_u_s2 &gt; 5.38} \\longrightarrow \\text{mrt_liverfat_s2 = B}\\). The value distribution among the labeled participants reveals that ageing might be a risk factor for the displayed subpopulation as the likelihood of class B increases with higher age. This visual finding suggests adding the condition \\(\\text{age_ship_s2} &gt; 56.8\\) to the rules antecedent. Indeed, the confidence of this more specific rule increases from 38/68=0.56 to 27/40=0.675. However, since the sensitivity reduces from 38/108=0.352 to 27/108=0.250, the minimum value count threshold is no longer satisfied. Hence, the visualization of the participants statistics for selected rules can deliver indications on subpopulations that should be monitored closer, and hints on how to alter the algorithm parameters for subsequent runs, in our example, to lower the minimum value count to 0.25 and to increase the maximum rule length to 3. 3.3 Experiments and Findings 3.3.1 Results of Decision Tree Classifiers For the evaluation of decision tree classifiers, we consider accuracy, i.e., the ratio of correctly classified participants, sensitivity and specificity, and the \\(F_1\\) score, i.e., the harmonic mean between precision and recall. For specificity, precision and recall, we consider the two classes B and C together as positive class. Oversampling achieved best performance with an accuracy of ca. 80% and an \\(F_1\\)score of 62%. The best decision trees were found for partition \\(\\mathsf{F:age&gt;52}\\), followed by those for \\(\\mathsf{PartitionF}\\), then \\(\\mathsf{PartitionM}\\). The large discrepancy between accuracy and \\(F_1\\)score appears also in the models of the partitions, underlying that accuracy scores are unreliable in such a skewed distribution. Therefore, we do not report on accuracy hereafter. On partition \\(\\mathsf{F:age&gt;52}\\), the overall best decision tree is achieved by the oversampling variant. On the larger \\(\\mathsf{PartitionF}\\), best performance was achieved by the decision tree produced with the InfoGain variant, while the best decision tree on \\(\\mathsf{PartitionM}\\) was built with the CostMatrix variant. Sensitivity and specificity values for these trees are shown in Table 3.2, while the trees themselves are depicted in Figures 3.6 - 3.8 respectively and discussed in subsection ??. Table: (#tab:03-tree-performance-sens-spec) Best decision trees for the three partitions: best separation is achieved in \\(\\mathsf{F:age&gt;52}\\); \\(\\mathsf{PartitionM}\\) is the most heterogeneous one, the performance values are lowest. Partition Variant Sensitivity (%) Specificity (%) \\(F_1\\) score (%) \\(\\mathsf{F:age}\\)&gt;\\(\\mathsf{52}\\) Oversampling 63.5 93.9 81.5 \\(\\mathsf{PartitionF}\\) InfoGain 52.4 94.9 69.7 \\(\\mathsf{PartitionM}\\) CostMatrix 38.3 86.3 53.0 Table 3.2 indicates that the decision tree variants perform differently on different partitions. Oversampling is beneficial for \\(\\mathsf{F:age&gt;52}\\), because it partially compensates the skew problem. As \\(\\mathsf{PartitionM}\\) has the most heterogeneous class distribution out of all paritions, all variants perform relatively poor on it. Hence, we expected most insights from the decision trees on \\(\\mathsf{F:age&gt;52}\\) and \\(\\mathsf{PartitionF}\\), where better separation is achieved.

The classification rules found on the partitions were more informative. However, classification rules with only one feature in the antecedent had low confidence. To ensure high confidence, we restricted the output on rules with at least two features in the antecedent. To ensure a still high coverage, we allowed for at most three features. A selection of high confidence and high coverage rules for each partition and class are shown in Tables 3.3  3.5, respectively. We describe the most important features in the antecedent of these rules in the next subsection, together with the most important features of the best decision trees.

For better readability, the tree nodes in the figures contain short descriptions instead of the original variable names. In all three decision trees, the root node is the ultrasound diagnosis variable stea_s2. A negative ultrasound diagnosis points to the negative class A, but a positive ultrasound diagnosis does not directly lead to one of the positive classes B and C. The decision trees of the three partitions differ in the nodes placed near the root. In the best decision tree of \\(\\mathsf{PartitionF}\\) (cf. Figure 3.7) we observe that if the ultrasound report is positive and the HbA1C concentration is more than 6.8%, the class is C. The classification rules with high coverage and confidence in Table 3.3) point to further interesting features: a waist circumference of at most 80 cm, a BMI of no more than 24.82 kg/m2, a hip circumference of 97.8 cm or less characterize participants of the negative class. All 6 participants with a serum glucose concentration greater than 7 mmol/l and a TSH concentration greater than 0.996 mu/l belong to class C. Further, severe obesity (a BMI value of more than 38.42 kg/m2 points to class C with high confidence  but only in combination with other variables. In contrast to the best tree for \\(\\mathsf{PartitionF}\\), the best decision tree for the subpartition \\(\\mathsf{F:age&gt;52}\\) (cf. Figure ~3.6) also contains nodes with SNPs, indicating potentially genetic associations to fatty liver for these participants. Classification rules with high coverage and confidence for class B also contain SNPs, as can be seen in Table ~3.4. Similarly to \\(\\mathsf{PartitionF}\\), high BMI values point to a positive class when combined with other features: in Table 3.4, we see that all four participants with stea_alt75_s2 = 3 (i.e. a positive ultrasound diagnosis combined with a critical ALAT value) and a BMI larger than 38.42 kg/m2 belong to class C. A similar association holds for stea_alt75_s2 = 3 combined with a high waist circumference (&gt; 124 cm). 19 out of 20 participants in class B having a positive ultrasound diagnosis, a genetic marker gx_rs11597390 = 1 and a serum HDL concentration of at most 1.53 mmol/l. The role of the ultrasound report in predicting the negative class is the same for \\(\\mathsf{PartitionM}\\) (cf. Figure 3.8 as for \\(\\mathsf{PartitionF}\\). As with the best tree for \\(\\mathsf{F:age&gt;52}\\), the best tree for \\(\\mathsf{PartitionM}\\) contains nodes with SNPs and serum GGT value ranges. Such features are also in the antecedent of top Hotspot rules (cf. Table ~3.5): a Serum GGT concentration of more than 1.9,\\(\\mu\\)mol/sl in combination with creatinine concentration of at most 90 mmol/l or a thromboplastin time ratio (quick_s2) of more than 59% point to class C. Similarly, positive ultrasound diagnosis and a serum HDL concentration not exceeding 0.84 mmol/l point to class C. The decision trees and classification rules give insights into features that seem diagnostically important. However, the medical expert needs additional information to decide whether a feature is worth further investigation. In particular, decision trees highlight the importance of a feature only in the context of the subtree it is located; a subtree describes a subpopulation that is usually very small. In contrast, classification rules return information on larger subpopulations. However, these subpopulations may overlap; for example, the first four rules on class C for \\(\\mathsf{PartitionM}\\) (cf. Table 3.5) may refer to the same 6 participants. Moreover, unless a classification rule has a confidence close to 100 %, there may be participants in the other classes that also support it. Hence, to decide whether the features in the rules antecedent deserve further investigation, the expert also needs insights on the rules statistics for the other classes as well. To assist the expert in this task, we propose the Interactive Medical Miner, a tool that discovers classification rules for each class and delivers information on the statistics of these rules for all classes. 3.3.3.1 Enhancements In (Niemann, Spiliopoulou, et al. 2014a), we added functionalities to specify a (sub-)cohort of the dataset, for example, to focus on the subset of female participants. In an additional window, the expert can specify filtering queries in the form of Variable Operator Value. The defined restrictions are shown in a table where the user can undo previous constraints. Further, the user can (de-)select variables for model generation. For example, the expert might exclude a variable that is known to be highly correlated with another variable that is already considered for model learning. (Schleicher et al. 2017) added panels that contain tables displaying additional rule statistics such as lift and p-value. Further, a mosaic chart juxtaposes the class distributions of a subpopulation and its complements which are subgroups of participants who do not match one or both of the conditions of the length-2 rule which describes that subpopulation. In this paper, we study SD on a binary target variable problem (positive or negative outcome). A subpopulation of \\(r\\), \\(s(r)\\) is the set of instances that satisfy the antecedent of a rule \\(r\\), also known as cover set of \\(r\\). % % %A subpopulation comprises of instances that fulfill the logical condition of a rules antecedent; ae a rule is described as: % %Further, \\(|s(r)_{T=v}|\\) is the number of instances that additionally belong to the value for the target variable in \\(s(r)\\), the support set; \\(n\\) is the total number of instances in the dataset; \\(n_{T=v}\\) is the total number of instances which exhibit the target variable value of interest. % % The conjunction of feature - feature value pairs of left to the arrow constitute the rules antecedent (or left hand site), while the pair of target feature - target feature value right to the arrow is the rules consequent (or right hand side). The rule in Equation (3.2) is a classification rule referring to class B. Features with continuous values (e.g. age, waist) are restricted within a specific range. This range is chosen by the algorithm in such a way as to maximize the support of the rule within the cohort and the confidence of the rules consequent given the antecedent. The first rule in the example belongs to the results on \\(\\mathsf{PartitionF}\\) (see Table ??, described in the next section): out of the 20 participants supporting the antecedent, 17 belong to class B. Note that we use the expressions and . For classification rule discovery we use the Weka algorithm HotSpot. For each class, this algorithm determines the rules with the best confidence the optimal boundary values for the features in the antecedent. We have wrapped the algorithm into a mechanism that selects for each class only rules supported by at least \\(\\tau\\) participants. In our experiments, we use \\(\\tau=\\frac{1}{3}\\), but our interactive tool (section ??) allows the expert to set this threshold freely. 3.4 Benefits of Our Workflow (Qing-dao-er-ji, Pang, and Chang 2020) References "],["sdclu.html", "Chapter 4 Identifying Distinct Subpopulations 4.1 Motivation and Comparison with Related Work 4.2 Finding Distinct Classification Rules 4.3 Experiments and Findings 4.4 Benefits of our Method", " Chapter 4 Identifying Distinct Subpopulations We study redundancy in large sets of rules that describe subpopulations. We present a workflow that extracts a smaller number of representative rules. &gt; These rules are selected in such a way to avoid instance overlap as much as possible, and hence to cover distinct concepts in the data space. We evaluate our workflow on samples of SHIP with hepatic steatosis and goiter as target variables. This chapter is based on the following publication: Niemann, U., M. Spiliopoulou, B. Preim, et al. Combining Subgroup Discovery and Clustering to Identify Diverse Subpopulations in Cohort Study Data. In: Proc. of IEEE Int. Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS). 2017, pp. 582-587. DOI: 10.1109/CBMS.2017.15. distinctiveness, interestingness, concepts Epidemiologists search for significant relationships between risk factors and outcome in large and heterogeneous datasets that encompass participant health information gathered from questionnaires and medical examinations. In the previous chapter, we described a expert-driven worklow that can help epidemiologists to automatically detect such relationships in form of classification rules, which are descriptions of risk factors and predictive value ranges in for a specific subpopulation and an outcome of interest. However, rule induction algorithms often produce large and overlapping rule sets requiring the expert to manually pick the most interesting rules and to remove less interesting or redundant rules. This post-filtering step is time-consuming and tedious. This chapter presents a clustering-based algorithm that hierarchically reorganizes large rule sets and summarizes all important concepts while maintaining distinciveness between the clusters. For each cluster, a representative rule is shown to the expert who in turn can drill-down to other cluster members. We evaluate our algorithm on two subsets of SHIP where the outcomes hepatic steatosis and goiter serve as target variable, respectively. Further, we report on effectiveness of our algorithm and we present selected subpopulations. 4.1 Motivation and Comparison with Related Work Subgroup discovery (SD) algorithms aim to uncover interesting relationships between one or more conditions (variables and value ranges) and a target variable in the form of classification rules (Herrera et al. 2011; AtzmÃ¼ller 2015). Compared with more accurate but predominantly opaque black-box models such as neural networks, support vector machines or random forests, SD algorithms trade off higher confidence with a superior interpretability of the which makes them highly applicable to domain expert-guided subpopulation discovery. SD algorithms have been used in several medical studies where descriptive knowledge had to be derived, e.g. for extracting potential drug targets from multi-relational data sources for the treatment of dementia (Nguyen, Priami, and Caberlotto 2015), for identifying predictive auditoryperceptual, speech-acoustic and articulatory kinematic characteristics of preschoolers with speech sound disorders (Vick et al. 2014) and for discovering discriminatory characteristics in patient subpopulations with different psychiatric emergency department admission times (Carmona et al. 2011). However, SD methods often return large sets of rules which domain experts are unwilling to tediously go through all of them to manually separate interesting from irrelevant and redundant rules. A common observation is that there are groups of rules covering nearly the same set of instances, as illustrated in Figure 4.1. Instead of presenting all rules found by an SD algorithm at once, we propose to organize sets of rules in a hierarchical way such that the domain expert is able to explore a compact set of different concepts, equipped with mechanisms to drill-down to specific rules of interest. Figure 4.1: Example of two redundant rules: both \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\) cover the instances 7,8,9,10; \\(r_2\\) additionally covers instance 2. The cover set overlap is due to the high correlation between #Teeth and Age, and between BMI and Waist circumference. Both rules describe the same concept, i.e., elderly overweight people have a higher risk of the outcome. Similar to the HotSpot algorithm described in Section 3.2.4, popular SD algorithms such as SubgroupMiner (KlÃ¶sgen and May 2002), SD (Gamberger and Lavrac 2002) and CN2-SD (Lavra et al. 2004) use a fixed beam width to limit the number of further expanded subgroup candidates at each iteration. A post-pruning step can be applied to reduce the cardinality of the rule set  for example, to return the top-k rules  using a quality criterion such as weighted relative accuracy or p-value of a statistical test. Even if both beam width search and top-\\(k\\) pruning are applied, the result often still contains redundant rules. This is due to correlation between the (non-target) variables, which lead to large numbers of variations of a particular finding. Especially top-\\(k\\) pruning leads to different variations of the same concepts (in other words large instance overlap) (Leeuwen and Knobbe 2012). % Figure 4.2: Graphical representation of 1115 HotSpot rules found on SHIP data from 886 labeled instances. A gray cell means that the instance at that x-postion is covered by the rule of the associated y-position. Instances and rules are sorted by agglomerative hierarchical clustering. When partitioned into 10 clusters based on covered instances, the rules in each cluster describe similar subpopulations. In contrast to SD that produce multiple rules that overlap with respect to their cover sets, predictive rule learning algorithms such as CN2 (Clark and Niblett 1989) or RIPPER (Cohen 1995) are designed to yield rules that capture different spaces in the data. They work in an iterative fashion following a divide-and-conquer strategy (FÃ¼rnkranz, Gamberger, and Lavra 2012): First, on the set of not yet covered instances, a rule is generated that maximizes the algorithms quality function. Second, all covered instances are removed from the training set. This procedure of rule induction and removal of instances from the training set is repeated until all instances are covered by at least one rule. The output of these algorithm is often a decision list. To classify an instance, the prediction of the first rule which covers the instance is used. While these algorithms avoid the problem of rule redundancy, important concepts may remain uncovered. Furthermore, coverage of the rules generally decreases with each iteration. Low coverage rules are negligible in epidemiological studies as they might represent spurious correlations of study sample. Instead of just eliminating covered instances from rule induction of subsequent iterations, weighted covering approaches take into account how often instances have been covered so far in the rule candidate expansion step (Lavra et al. 2004). While this leniency towards instance removal enables a larger number of rules, a new hyperparameter is introduced which controls the tradeoff between reutilization of already covered instances and minimum rule confidence. TODO: Stimmt das? This parameter is unintuive and hard to set, especially for domain experts. Further, both traditional predictive rule learning algorithms and their weighted covering extensions introduce order dependencies among rules: a rule is dependent on all previous rules in the rule list and the instances of the target variable they cover, and it may not be meaningful to interprete an individual rule. LATER In this study, we propose SD-Clu, a novel algorithm that combines subgroup discovery with clustering to return a set of \\(k\\) representative classification rules. Building up on a set of potentially highly overlapping rules generated by a SD algorithm, we leverage hierarchical agglomerative clustering to find groups of rules that cover different sets of instances. For each cluster, we nominate one rule as the groups representative that exhibits best trade-off between rule confidence and coverage towards the target variable. %We define similarity between a pair of subgroups based on the fraction of mutually covered instances and individually covered instances (SÃ¸rensenDice index, Jaccard index, cosine similarity). Rules covering (almost) the same instances are likely to be condensed into the same cluster and thus more likely to be represented by a proxy rule. We evaluate our algorithm on two samples from the investigating the diseases hepatic steatosis and goiter. The paper is organized as follows. Section?? contains related work on classification rule induction. Section?? briefly reviews fundamental notations and quality measures of SD. Section?? describes the SHIP samples and introduces SD-Clu. We present our experimental results in section??. In the last section, we conclude with a summary and outlook. 4.2 Finding Distinct Classification Rules TODO: outline We proposed the algorithm SD-Clu that combines subgroup discovery with clustering to return a set of \\(k\\) distinct classification rules. The algorithm consists of three main steps. First, a SD algorithm generateds a set of potentially highly overlapping rules. Using hierachical agglomerative clustering, this rule set is then grouped into set of distinct rule clusters that cover different sets of instances. For each cluster, the rule which exhibits best trade-off between confidence and coverage towards the target variable is nominated the groups representative. Rules covering the same instances are pooled into the same cluster and hence are represented by the same proxy rule. 4.2.1 Rule clustering We use the same notation for classification rule discovery as in Section @ref(#imm-classification). Agglomerative hierarchical custering iteratively merges similar instances to clusters, in a bottom-up way. The order of merging two clusters depends on the linkage strategy: in complete linkage the distance between two clusters is defined as the maximum distance between any two of their instances. The pair of clusters minimizing this maximum distance are selected for merging. A dendrogram is a tree representation of this stepwise process. Optionally, a parameter \\(k\\) can be specified to obtain a specific partitioning. We define rule similarity for clustering on the basis of the mutually covered instances as an adaption of the SÃ¸rensenDICE coefficient (Dice 1945). The distance between two rules \\(r_1\\), \\(r_2\\) with corresponding subpopulations \\(s(r_1)\\), \\(s(r_2)\\) is given as \\[ \\text{dist}(r_1,r_2) = 1 - \\frac{2\\cdot\\left|s(r_1)\\cap s(r_2)\\right|}{\\left|s(r_1)\\right| + \\left|s(r_2)\\right|}. \\] The number of clusters can be specified as parameter \\(k\\). Alternatively, we describe an approach that derives an appropriate \\(k\\) from the rule set using a cluster quality function such as the silhouette coefficient. For a clustering \\(\\xi\\) and a set of rules \\(R\\), the silhouette coefficient is calculated as \\[ \\text{Silh}(R,\\xi) = \\frac{1}{|R|}\\sum_{r\\in R}{\\frac{b(r)-a(r)}{\\max\\left\\{a(r), b(r)\\right\\}}} \\] where \\[a(r)=\\frac{\\sum_{y\\in{}Y}\\text{dist}(r,y)}{|Y|-1}\\] is the average dissimilarity between \\(r\\) and the other rules in the cluster \\(Y\\in\\xi\\) which contains \\(r\\), while \\[b(r)=\\frac{\\sum_{y\\in{}Z}\\text{dist}(r,y)}{|Z|}\\] is the average dissimilarity between \\(r\\) and the rules in the cluster \\(Z\\in\\xi\\) which is the closest to the cluster \\(Y\\) containing \\(r\\). Then, we traverse the dendrogram bottom-up, compute the silhouette for each set of clusters \\(\\xi\\) and select as \\(\\xi_{opt}\\) the set of clusters with the best silhouette value. The optimal number of clusters is then the cardinality \\(|\\xi_{opt}|\\). Finally, we map each cluster \\(Y\\in\\xi_{opt}\\) to a representative rule. To do so, we invoke the rule interestingness measure Weighted Relative Accuracy (WRA hereafter) which balances coverage and confidence gain and is defined as \\[WRA(r)=Cov(r)\\cdot\\left(Conf(r)-\\frac{n_{T=v}}{N}\\right)\\] where \\(N\\) is the total number of instances in the dataset and \\(n_{T=v}\\) is the number of instances with the target variable value of interest. We compute WRA for each rule \\(r\\in{Y}\\) and select as cluster proxy \\(cp(Y)\\) the rule for which WRA is maximum. 4.2.2 Representativeness of a set of cluster proxies The rule proxies should be a good representation of the total rule set. Thus, each instance should be covered equally often by the cluster proxies compared to the total rule set. Hence, we define representativeness as difference between the average fraction of proxy rules the instances are covered by and the total average fraction of rules the instances are covered by. If the difference between the two ratios is small, then the representativeness of the cluster proxy rules is high. Typically, the set of rule clusters \\(\\zeta\\) for a set of rules \\(R\\) will be the optimal set of clusters, as described in the previous subsection, but it can be any set of clusters chosen by the user, as long as it contains all rules in \\(R\\). For \\(\\zeta\\), let \\(R_{\\zeta}=\\{cp(Y)|Y\\in\\zeta\\}\\) denote the set of cluster proxy rules. To quantify how representative such a set of rules is, we proceed as follows. First, let \\(U\\subseteq{}R\\) be an arbitrary subset of the complete set of rules, and let \\(x\\) be an instance. The coverage rate of \\(x\\) towards \\(U\\) is calculated as \\[ covRate(x,U) = \\frac{\\sum_{r\\in{}U}isCovered(x,r)}{|U|} \\] where \\(isCovered(x,r)\\) is equal to 1, if \\(r\\) covers \\(x\\), i.e., \\(x\\in s(r)\\), and 0 otherwise. We observe that for a set of rules \\(U\\), an instance \\(x\\) cannot be covered by more than \\(|U|\\) rules. Let \\(R_x\\) be the set of rules that cover instance \\(x\\), i.e., for \\(R_x=\\{r\\in{}U | isCovered(x,r)=1 \\}\\). For the whole set of instances \\(X\\) we create bins: \\[ bin_i(U)= \\{x \\in{}X | |R_x|=i \\}. \\] Further, let \\(bin_0(U)= \\{x \\in{}X | \\forall r\\in U : isCovered(x,r)=0 \\}\\). Evidently, an instance \\(x\\) can be covered by \\(0, 1, \\ldots, |U|\\) rules, i.e. \\(covRate(x,U)\\) can take one of \\(|U|+1\\) values. In contrast, \\(covRate(x,R)\\) can take one of \\(|R|+1\\) values, a usually much larger number. We therefore map the possible values of \\(covRate(x,R)\\) into the much smaller set of possible values by rounding, computing: \\[ adjCovRate(x,U, R)=\\frac{\\lfloor covRate(x,R)\\cdot|U| \\rceil}{|U|} \\] where \\(\\lfloor\\rceil\\) is the rounding operator. Then, for the complete set of instances \\(X\\), a set of induced rules \\(R\\), the clustering \\(\\zeta\\) over \\(R\\) and the set of cluster proxy rules \\(R_{\\zeta}\\), the representativeness of \\(R_{\\zeta}\\) is defined as \\[ representativeness(R_{\\zeta},R)=1- \\frac{1}{|X|}\\sum_{x\\in{}X} |adjCovRate(x,U,R) - covRate(x,R_{\\zeta})|. \\] 4.3 Experiments and Findings 4.3.1 Data To evaluate our method, we used data from the SHIP study. A description of SHIP is provided in Section 2.6.1. As target variables, we considered hepatic steatosis (cf. Section 3.2.1) and goiter. For the sample HepStea, we derived a binary target variable by discretizing the liver fat concentration obtained from the MRI report, such that study participants with a concentration of not more than 10% are mapped to the negative class and values greater than 10% are mapped to the positive class indicating presence of the disease. From 886 participants for which the MRI report of SHIP-2 was available at that time, 694 (78.3%) were negative and 192 (21.7%) were positive. We considered 99 variables, chosen exclusively from SHIP-0, to assess their long-term impact, as expressed 10 years later in SHIP-2. For the sample Goiter, the target variable was derived by thyroid ultrasound. Presence of goiter was defined for a thyroid volume exceeding 18ml in women and 25ml in men (Gutekunst et al. 1988). Out of the 4400 participants for which the target variable is available in TREND-0, 3010 belong to the negative class (68.4%) and 1390 (31.6%) to the positive class. Apart from the target variable, we use a total of 182 variables that were pre-selected by a medical expert as potential risk factors. 4.3.2 SD Algorithms For subgroup discovery, the two algorithms HotSpot (Hall et al. 2009) (cf. Section 3.2.4 and SD-Map (AtzmÃ¼ller and Puppe 2006). SD-Map is an exhaustive algorithm that adapts the popular FP-growth association rule learning method (Han, Pei, and Yin 2000). Rules that fall below a minimum coverage threshold are pruned. A depth-first search for candidate generation is executed. Rules are ranked according to a user-specified quality function. We used the implementation from the VIKAMINE framework (AtzmÃ¼ller and Lemmerich 2012). The implementation of SD-Map supports only categorical variables. Therefore, every numeric variable was discretized using the MDL-based approach of Fayyad et al. (Fayyad and Irani 1993). For SD-Map, we set the minimum coverage threshold to 0.05 to avoid too small, overfitting rules. We leverage WRA as quality function and define a minimum threshold value of 0.025. For HotSpot, we set the support threshold of a rule to exceed 0.05. The beam width is set to 500. Further, to avoid rather meaningless literals, we restrict expanding of a rule body with another literal to a relative confidence gain of at least 0.3. 4.3.3 Results Figure 4.3 shows the optimal number of clusters for each combination of study sample and SD algorithm. Table 4.1 depicts the optimal \\(k\\) and the ratio of proxy rules vs. total number of rules. For example, the clustering with optimal silhouette coefficient for the algorithm HotSpot on Goiter has 76 clusters and thus 76 rule cluster proxies (cf.Table 4.1), which makes only 21.3% of the total number of rules. Thus, by showing the expert only the cluster proxies in the beginning, the amount of time they will spend inspecting the rules will decrease. Figure 4.3: Silhouette coefficients (\\(Silh\\)) of SD-Clu using complete linkage for each combination of dataset and algorithm. The cardinality of the clustering with the highest \\(Silh\\) score (\\(|\\zeta_{opt}|\\)) is indicated by a dashed vertical line. Table: (#tab:04-silh) Number of rules \\(|R|\\), optimal silhouette coefficient \\(Silh(\\zeta_{opt})\\), the corresponding cardinality of the optimal clustering \\(|\\zeta_{opt}|\\) and percentage of cluster proxies relative to the total number of rules for every combination of data sample and SD algorithm. Dataset Algorithm \\(|R|\\) \\(Silh(\\zeta_{opt})\\) \\(|\\zeta_{opt}|\\) \\(\\frac{|\\zeta_{opt}|}{|R|} [\\%]\\) HepStea HotSpot 208 0.41 100 48.1 HepStea SD-Map 68 0.40 30 44.1 Goiter HotSpot 356 0.37 76 21.0 Goiter SD-Map 106 0.66 54 51.6 The optimal cardinality of \\(\\zeta_{opt}\\) shown in Figure 4.3 could be used as a suggestion, but the expert is free to specify the number of rules they want to obtain. For instance, if the expert thinks \\(|\\zeta_{opt}|=100\\) for HotSpot on HepStea is too large, the diagram would show them that a reduction to \\(|\\zeta_{opt}|=58\\) is possible where \\(Silh\\) reduces just slightly from 0.48 to 0.37. Also in the other direction: if \\(|\\zeta_{opt}|\\) is rather low, the diagram indicates that a minor increase does not change \\(Silh\\) strongly; thus the added rules may be important also. The expert could even analyze the diagram to derive a range instead of a single value, e.g. the range where \\(Silh\\) is above 90% of its maximum. To evaluate representativeness of cluster proxies, we compare them to three baseline criteria which return the top-\\(k\\) rules according to Odds Ratio (baseline 1), coverage (baseline 2) and WRA (baseline 3). Figure 4.4 juxtaposes representativeness of SD-Clu and the three baselines for varying numbers of rules \\(k\\) returned to the expert for the HotSpot algorithm on the HepStea sample. The diagrams are arranged by rule selection approach (rows) and number of representative rules \\(k\\) returned to the expert (columns). Each diagram shows the \\(adjCovRate\\) (y-axis) of the instances (x-axis) with respect to \\(R\\) (solid black curve). Instances are sorted by the number of rules in \\(R\\) they are covered by with their repspective \\(covRate\\) shown as points. The dotted curve represents a locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS) fit of the points. Ideally, both curves are close to each, meaning that instances are covered by nearly the same fraction of cluster proy rules as fraction of rules in general. Figure 4.4: \\(representativeness\\) of SD-Clu and three baseline approaches for different numbers of clusters \\(k\\) on the HepStea sample using HotSpot. Points depict an instances \\(adjCovRate\\) with respect to the set of representative rules of the approach (row) and \\(k\\) (column). Instances are sorted by \\(covRate\\) with respect to \\(R\\) , i.e., the set of all rules) in descending order, shown by a solid black curve. A dotted curve depicts a LOWESS regression fit on the points. The similarity between solid and dotted curve illustrates \\(representativeness\\) of the top-\\(k\\) rules of the prespective approach. This is illustrated by the dark gray area in-between solid curve and dotted curve where smaller areas are better and reflect higher \\(representativeness\\) values. PUT THE PLOTS OF THE OTHER PARTITIONS INTO THE APPENDIX For all approaches, \\(representativeness\\) improves with increasing number of representative rules \\(k\\). For example, \\(representativeness\\) increases from 0.87 to 0.96 for SD-Clu and \\(k=10\\) to \\(k=50\\) which means that the absolute difference between \\(adjCovRate\\) of \\(\\zeta\\) and \\(covRate\\) of \\(R\\) over all instances successively decreases. Further, for a given \\(k\\), the representative rules of the baselines are less representative than SD-Clus cluster proxy rules, e.g. 0.91, 0.92, 0.91 vs. 0.96 for \\(k=50\\), respectively (cf. 5th column of plot matrix in Figure 4.4). 4.3.4 Findings Tables 4.2 and 4.3 depict the antecendents, support, and confidence cluster proxy rules found by two algorithms for HepStea and Goiter with \\(k\\)=5. The prevalence of hepatic steatosis, resp. goiter, in each the subpopulations described by these rules is considerably higher than in the corresponding complete population. These subpopulations are characterized by known risk factors for hepatic steatosis, such as large waist circumference and BMI, blood pressure and hypertension, ageing and high scores in some of the medical tests (ALAT and LDL). Further, apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1), a major protein component of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles in plasma, was found to be associated with the outcome (see fourth Hotspot rule in Tables 4.2) in elderly patients. Lipoprotein metabolism is considered as the major process contributing to the emergence of fatty liver (Jiang, Robson, and Yao 2013). Furthermore, Poynard et al. (Poynard et al. 1986) found that hepatic steatosis patients had higher ApoA1 concentrations than liver fibrosis patients who in turn had higher values than liver cirrhosis patients. The fifth Hotspot rule describes a subpopulation with increased values of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) of the liver (ca. 0.80-quantile) and increased values of uric acid (ca. 0.36-quantile). Lizardi-Cervera et al. (Lizardi-Cervera et al. 2007) reported an increased concentration of ultra-sensitive CRP in subjects with hepatic steatosis independently of other metabolic conditions. Likewise, Keenan et al. (Keenan et al. 2012) found increased levels of uric acid in patients with hepatic steatosis independently of metabolic syndrome.

Table 4.3), the identified subpopulations are characterized by common risk factors such as increased weight and body mass index. Participants prescribed with angiotensin II receptor blocker (see second HotSpot rule) xxxx Further, the first HotSpot rule describes that participants with an intima-media thickness of more than 0.73 mm (ca. 0.80-quantile). Previous studies found links between intima-media thickness and thyroid-stimulating hormone (Takamura et al. 2009) and subclinical hypothyroidism (Gao et al. 2013; Unal et al. 2017). The condition of the third HotSpot rule describes the duration of an ECG phase. In their survey, Jabbar et al. (Jabbar et al. 2017) summarized that pathologic thyroid hormone levels increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases. This relationship appears to be particularly present in the elderly (Fazio et al. 2004). The fourth rule suggests specific thrombocyte levels to be indicative of increased thyroid gland volume, corroborating Erikci et al. (Erikci et al. 2009) who found that hypothyroidism patients had higher platelet volume and platelet distribution width than a control group.

By limiting the number of rules time spent for rule inspection is reduced. SD-Clu nominates a representative rule from a hierarchical clustering from a large set of rules, and thus returns rules that express distinct concepts, i.e., rules that cover different sets of instances. The introduced representativeness measure assesses whether instances are similarly often covered by representatives as by the total rule set. SD-Clu was evaluated on two samples from an epidemiological study where an optimal set of proxy rules was selected that (i) contains considerably less rules than the total rule set and (ii) is more representative compared to the baseline approaches, respectively.

We present novel radial bar and radar visualizations to juxtapose phenotypes in a high-dimensional feature space and to explore phenotype-specific idiosyncracies. We provide a web application with enhanced versions of these visualizations that incorporate average treatment effects. This chapter is based on the following publication: Niemann, U., P. Brueggemann, B. Boecking, et al. Phenotyping chronic tinnitus patients using self-report questionnaire data: cluster analysis and visual comparison. In: Scientific Reports 10.1 (2020), p. 16411. DOI: 10.1038/s41598-020-73402-8. &lt;URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-73402-8&gt;. The supervised methods of classification and subgroup discovery described in the previous chapters show great potential for applications where there is one or a small number of well-defined target variables. However, some medical conditions have heterogeneous appearances which are not well understood yet. For example, chronic tinnitus is a complex, multi-factorial and heterogeneous symptom. Clinical assessment and selection of a suitable therapy strategies are difficult as not all patients benefit equally from treatment. Due to the large number and heterogeneity of available assessment tools, unsupervised methods like cluster analysis appear to be promising approaches to extract clinically relevant tinnitus phenotypes. Clinical acceptance of these empirical results can be further strengthened by a comprehensive visualization which intuitively illustrate major characteristics of a phenotype and differences between multiple phenotypes. In this chapter, we describe a workflow (1) to identify distinct tinnitus phenotypes by a parameter-free clustering algorithm and (2) to visualize these subgroups to explore phenotype idiosyncrasies. ToDo: Gliederung 6.1 Motivation and comparison with related work In Subsection 2.6.4, we described challenges for tinnitus treatment and management due to the clinical heterogeneity of tinnitus and heterogeneity in its pathophysiology. Thus, the development of suitable and effective treatment strategies may benefit from identifying distinct patient subgroups. Since clinically relevant subgroups have not been established yet, clustering emerges as a promising approach to identify distinct tinnitus phenotypes in a data-driven and hypothesis-free way. Previous studies found subgroups of tinnitus patients with cluster analysis based on a small number of audiometric features (Langguth et al. 2017), a combination of features extracted from self-reports, audiometry and psychoacoustics (Tyler et al. 2008), or neuroimaging data and socio-demographics (Schecklmann et al. 2012). Although each of these studies provided insights in tinnitus subgroup patterns, acceptance among medical scholars may be increased by presenting the clustering results with intuitive visualizations that show individual subgroup patterns and enable the visual juxtaposition of multiple subgroups with respect to high-dimensional data. In this respect, Schlee et al. (Schlee et al. 2017) proposed a compact radar chart visualization that allows to compare the degree of health burden between individuals or subgroups based. While their visualization could be applied to any disease domain, Schlee et al. demonstrated its efficacy showing subgroup differences with respect to measurements of tinnitus distress and associated comorbidities. However, Schlee et al. did not aim to visualize clustering results, but restricted themselves to pre-defined cohorts by graphically comparing female against male patients, and patients with low tinnitus frequency against patients with high tinnitus frequency. 6.2 Features From the routine questionnaire assessment battery, we selected a total of 64 features from 14 questionnaires, including 49 compound scores and 15 single-item measurements Appendix A &gt; From a total of 4,103 patients, data from 2,875 (70.1%) was incomplete and therefore excluded. The N=1,228 patients included in the final sample were only slightly, yet significantly younger than the excluded ones (\\(\\mu_{included}\\)= 50.0, \\(\\sigma_{included}\\)=11.9; \\(\\mu_{excluded}\\)= 51.7, \\(\\sigma_{excluded}\\)=13.6; \\(t\\)(2630.8)=4.0, p$&lt;$0.01). Additionally, for 989 of the included patients patients (80.5%) post-treatment data were also available and used to visually explore treatment effect differences between clusters. Most of the features have greater scores with higher health burden. We reversed the values of the remaining features which have greater scores with higher quality of life. For a \\(v_{original}^X\\) of a feature \\(X\\), the reversed value \\(v_{reversed}^X\\) is calculated as \\[v_{reversed}^X = \\max{X} - v_{original}^X\\]. The *-suffix in a feature name denotes a reversed feature. Due to widely differing value ranges, each feature was standardized via z-score normalization. A feature \\(X\\) with expected value \\(E(X)=\\mu\\) and variance \\(Var(X) = \\sigma^2\\) is standardized into \\[Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\]. For \\(Z\\), it holds true that \\(\\mu\\)=0 and \\(\\sigma^2\\)=1. 6.3 Identification of tinnitus phenotypes using clustering Practical considerations of data clustering include how to set the number of clusters \\(K\\). Since a ground truth is often not available, several heuristics to automatically determine \\(K\\) have been proposed. A popular approach is the so called elbow method which involves running the clustering algorithm with different values for \\(K\\). The number of clusters is plotted against cluster compactness. In the popular \\(K\\)-means algorithm, cluster compactness is quantified by total within-sum of squares (WSS), the sum of squared distances between each observation and its centroid over all clusters. As WSS or similar goodness of fit measures increase monotonically with increasing \\(K\\), the idea of the elbow method is to identify the curves characteristic knee point which is the first point from which adding another cluster leads only to a minor improvement in compactness. Because the plot is not guaranteed to exhibit such a distinctive knee point and universal compactness thresholds do not exist, this approach is often impracticable. Another popular clustering evaluation measure is the Silhouette coefficient which favor clusterings where similar objects are assigned to the same cluster and dissimilar objects are assigned to different cluster. Instead of a evaluating clustering quality post-hoc, we decided to chose an algorithm which internally identifies an appropriate number of clusters. X-means (Pelleg, Moore, and others 2000) is a parameter-free adaption of the popular K-means algorithm which incorporates the Bayesian information criterion (Schwarz and others 1978) (BIC) to find a good trade-off between low total sum of squares and a small number of clusters. Let \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) be the dataset with \\(d\\) dimensions and let \\(D\\) be a subset of \\(\\mathcal{D}\\), i.e., \\(D\\subseteq \\mathcal{D}\\). A K-means clustering on \\(D\\) creates the set of clusters \\(\\mathcal{C}=\\left\\{C_1,\\ldots,C_k,\\ldots,C_K\\right\\}\\), where \\(c_k\\) is the centroid of cluster \\(k\\), \\(r_k\\) is the number of objects in \\(D\\) assigned to \\(C_k\\) and \\(p\\) is the number of free parameters, i.e., \\(p = (d+1) \\cdot K\\). The BIC of a cluster \\(C_k\\) using the Schwarz criterion is calculated as \\(\\text{BIC}(C_k) = \\hat{l}_k(\\mathcal{D}) - \\frac{p_k}{2} \\cdot \\log |\\mathcal{D}|\\), where \\(\\hat{l}_k(\\mathcal{D})\\) is the log-likelihood of \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) according to \\(C_k\\). The point probabilities are computed as \\(\\hat{P}(x_i)=\\frac{r_{(i)}}{|\\mathcal{D}|}\\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\hat{\\sigma}}\\text{exp}\\left(\\frac{1}{2\\hat{\\sigma}^2}||x_i-c_{(i)}||\\right)\\), where the maximum likelihood estimate for the variance (under the identical spherical Gaussian assumption) is \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2=\\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{D}|-K}\\sum_{i=1}^{|\\mathcal{D}|}\\left(x_i - \\mu_{(i)}\\right)^2\\). The log-likelihood of \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) according to \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) is \\(l(\\mathcal{D})=\\log\\prod_{i=1}^{|\\mathcal{D}|} P(x_i)=\\sum_{i=1}^{|\\mathcal{D}|}\\left(\\log \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\hat{\\sigma}} - \\frac{1}{2 \\sigma^2} ||x_i-c_{(i)}||^2 + \\log \\frac{r_{(i)}}{|\\mathcal{D}|} \\right)\\). The steps of the X-means algorithm are shown in Figure 6.1. At the start, an initial partitioning is generated by ordinary K-means with \\(K=K_{lower}\\), where \\(K_{lower}\\) is a lower bound for the number of clusters. Then, each cluster is bisected; the resulting two child centroids are placed in opposite direction along a randomly chosen vector by a distance proportional to the cluster radius. For each pair of child clusters, a local K-means clustering with \\(K=2\\) is run. If the BIC score of the new partitioning exceeds the BIC score of the parental one, the child centroids are kept, otherwise the parent centroid is retained. The iterative steps are repeated until there is no cluster whose bisection leads to a better BIC score, or until the number of clusters exceeds an (optional) upper bound \\(K_{upper}\\). We used the R implementation of Ishioka (Ishioka 2005). Since we did not aim to restrict the solution space with resepect to the number of clusters, we set \\(K_{lower}=2\\), i.e., the lowest possible value, and we did not set \\(K_{upper}\\). Figure 6.1: Simplified representation of the X-means algorithm. Adapted from (Pelleg, Moore, and others 2000). 6.4 Visualisation of phenotypes Visualization of clusters in high dimensional data is challenging. Scatterplot matrices (SPLOMs) can intuitively represent the relationship between all features pairs as matrix of two-dimensional scatterplots Klemm et al. (2015). However, with increasing number of features the number of scatterplots grows quadratically which leads to scalability problems such as overplotting. Various advanced visualization techniques have been proposed as remedy, from simply adding transparency or colors to points to more sophisticated density contours, hexagon binning, layers showing aggregated geometric characteristics (minimal spanning trees, alpha shape, convex hull), animation, or combinations of multiple techniques such as splatterplots (Mayorga and Gleicher 2013). Still, SPLOMs and other traditional visualization techniques such as parallel coordinate charts (Hartigan 1975) are still rather suited for low-dimensional data. Dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques are often applied to project the original data onto a low-dimensional projections which makes it possible to use the above mentioned visualization types. Ideally, this projection preserves the most important structures of the original data, such as relative pairwise distance, clusters, outliers and correlations. Principal component analysis (Hotelling 1933) (PCA) is a seminal DR algorithm that generates linear, orthogonal combinations of the original dimensions. Each new dimensions, called principal component, holds a loading that quantifies how much variability of the data it covers. Usually, the first two or three dimensions which carry the highest loadings are selected for visualization. PCA is not robust in presence of outliers and is unable to capture non-linear relationships. Multi-dimensional scaling (Gower 1966) (MDS) is another early DR technique which puts emphasis on preserving pairwise distances, i.e., objects that are close in high-dimensional space should also be close in low-dimensional projected space. For complex, arbitrarily shaped structures, pairwise distances may be subject to the curse of dimensionality, which can lead to poor results. \\(t\\)-stochastic neighborhood embedding (Maaten and Hinton 2008) (\\(t\\)-SNE) and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (McInnes, Healy, and Melville 2018) (UMAP) are non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques that visualize a matrix of pairwise-similarities. The idea is to preserve both global structures like clusters as well as local structures including distances and neighbors. Both \\(t\\)-SNE and UMAP can produce superior projections compared to traditional linear techniques, provided their hyperparameters are appropriately tuned. However, a shortcoming of them is that the attribution of the original features cannot be quantified. Further, a projection cannot be applied to new observations; instead a new projection must be recomputed. Due to their stochasticity, different runs with the same hyperparameters can generate different results. Since the semantics of the original dimensions will be lost, we decided that DR techniques are not appropriate for this application. Discussions with tinnitus experts let to the following set of requirements for cluster visualization: preserve original (interpretable) features, represent high-dimensional data with dozens of features, compactly compare multiple clusters at a glance, juxtapose cluster characteristics with the overall patient mean. Following these requirements, we implemented (a) a radial bar chart as visualization of an individual cluster (Figure 6.2) and (b) a radial line chart visualization to compare multiple clusters at once 6.3. The radial bar chart serves to compare the observations assigned to a single cluster with the total population. Within-cluster feature averages are represented by bars arranged in a radial layout. Each bar starts at the black zero line which depicts the feature averages of the whole population, i.e., all subjects used for clustering. As features are standardized (i.e., z-score scaled) prior to clustering, bars inclined to the outside represent feature averages above the population average and bars inclined to the inside represent feature averages below the population average. For example, a bar whose top is positioned at -1 characterizes a within-cluster feature average that is 1 standard deviation smaller than the population average. Besides the combination of bar height and bar direction, within-cluster averages are also mapped to bar color by means of a sequential color gradient from dark blue (lower bound) to yellow (population average) to bright red (upper bound). Gray error lines at the top edge of a bar represent within-cluster standard error. To enable quick feature localization, features were grouped into categories displayed in the inner circle, alongside the cluster name and the number of assigned subjects. Tinnitus experts provided these categories which were (in clockwise order): tinnitus characteristics, physical quality of life, experiences of pain, somatic expressions, affective symptoms, tinnitus-related distress, internal resources, perceived stress, and mental quality of life. Figure 6.2: Radial barcharts for each of the 4 phenotypes (PT). (a) PT 1 characterizes the subgroup with lowest health burden. (b) PT 2 comprises the most suffering subjects, where all of the psychosomatic and somatic feature averages exceed the population average by more than 0.5 standard deviations (SD). (c) PT 3 exhibits above population average scores for somatic indicators. (d) PT 4 characterizes subjects with increased distress scores, including subjective stress and perceived quality of life. Bars are arranged in a circular layout where height and direction of a bar depicts the within-cluster feature average, and the gray line centered at the top of the bar illustrates the 95% confidence interval. Features were grouped into 9 categories defined by tinnitus experts. The categories are shown inside the inner circle. See Section 6.2 for a feature description. Adapted from (Niemann, Brueggemann, Boecking, Rose, et al. 2020). The radial line chart (6.3) enables a comparison of all clusters in a single plot. Instead of bars, feature averages are represented as points. Point of the same cluster and feature category are connected by line segments. Points and line segments are colored by their respective cluster. Figure 6.3: Radial line chart for phenotypes comparison. Points show within-phenotype feature averages. Points depicting features of the same category are connected with line segments. Points and lines are colored by cluster. See Figure @ref(fig: 06-all-radial-barcharts) for a description of the phenotypes and Section 6.2 for a description of the features. Adapted from (Niemann, Brueggemann, Boecking, Rose, et al. 2020). 6.5 Interactive components and exploration of treatment effects We provided an interactive demo of the cluster solutions and the visualizations as web application3 (Figure 6.4). The following interactive components were added to radial bar and line charts: hovering over bars or feature label opens tooltips with additional cluster summaries and compact feature descriptions. Clicking on a feature triggers an additional plot that shows the original (unscaled) distribution of the selected feature stratified by cluster, and if selected, also after treatment. For continuous features, semi-transparent boxplots placed on violin plot (Hintze and Nelson 1998) layers are shown. For categorical features, points and error lines represent category proportions and 95% confidence intervals, respectively. Although clustering was performed on baseline data only, we explored treatment effects to visually discover potential cluster-specific idiosyncrasies. For this purpose, we extended the radial bar chart by showing both pre-treatment (T0) and post-treatment (T1) averages as bars placed next to each other. The ends of a pair of bars are connected by a line with an arrow-head pointing to the bar of the average post-treatment score. To highlight large treatment effect magnitudes, connecting lines and feature labels are colored in green (decrease by min. \\(\\Delta\\cdot\\) SD from T0 to T1), red (increase by \\(\\Delta\\cdot\\) SD) or black (no considerable change), respectively. The parameter \\(\\Delta\\), the minimum relative magnitude of difference between T0 and T1 to be considered as change, is specified by the user. Figure 6.4: User interface of interactive demo. Radial bar charts were enhanced by interactive components: hovering over a bar or feature label opens a tooltip with additional cluster summaries and a compact feature description. Clicking on a feature updates the right plot showing the distribution of the selected feature stratified by cluster, and if selected, also after treatment. Continuous features are shown using semi-transparent boxplots placed on violin plot (Hintze and Nelson 1998) layers whereas for nominal features, category proportions alongside their 95% confidence intervals are displayed as points and error lines, respectively. xxx %========================================================================================= %========================================================================================= Kruskal-Wallis test was used for statistical comparison of inter-phenotype differences for continuous features (like age), and Pearsons chi-squared test was used for categorical features (like gender). % Differences were considered significant if p$&lt;$0.05. % Correction for multiple comparison was not conducted due to the exploratory nature of the study. % Confidence intervals for the means were estimated using %exact Binomial test for proportion features and nonparametric basic bootstrap sampling (Davison and Hinkley 1997) with 2,000 samples, respectively. % 6.6 Results TODO: Internal Bootstrap validation? Four clusters (also referred to as phenotypes hereafter) represent an optimal solution for the present data according to \\(X\\)-means. Phenotype 1 (PT 1) represents the largest subgroup (697 out of 1,228 patients; 56.8%), characterized by considerably below-average symptom expression across tinnitus-related and broader psychosomatic symptom indices, including affective symptoms, perceived stress, tinnitus-related distress and somatic symptoms, as well as (above-average) quality of life and internal resources (Figure ?? (a)). As this group of patients seek for help, present themselves in clinic and wish to participate in the multimodal treatment, it can be assumed that they experience psychological distress, but still aim to present themselves as unburdened as possible. Therefore, this phenotype is labeled as avoidant group. Patients in this subgroup exhibit comparatively high levels of education, employment and low periods of sick leave and psychotherapeutic treatment (Table ??). PT 2 comprised 173 patients (14.1%) who reported highest emotional and somatic burden among all PTs (Figure ?? (b)). More specifically, PT 2 represents a patient subgroup with high psychosomatic-comorbidity and is thus labeled psychosomatic group. This patient subgroup shows high tinnitus burden alongside clinically relevant impairment across all affective indices including depression, anxiety, and perceived stress. These affective symptoms appear to align with somatoform expressions of distress including somatic symptoms. Patients of these subgroup report severely reduced quality of life and reduced coping behavior with more pessimism, less experienced self-efficacy and optimism. Relative to the whole population, the proportion of women, patients who live alone, are unemployed or show an overall lower educational status is higher in this subgroup. Patients in this cluster further report to consult more doctors, take more sick days and use more psychotherapy. PT 2 patients stated the tinnitus sound to be audible in the entire head with greater percentage than the other groups. PT 3 contains 187 patients (15.2%) characterized by above-average scores of features measuring somatic complaints and near-average scores for affective symptoms (Figure ?? (c)). Since pain scores of SF8_bodilyhealth* and SSKAL_painfrequency were similarly large as for PT2, this patient subset was labeled somatic group. PT 3 includes the oldest subgroup, with the largest proportion of female patients and largest reported time period since tinnitus onset. Unlike PT3, PT 4 (n=171; 13.9%) exhibits above-average scores for affective scores, components of quality of life and perceived stress (Figure ?? (d)), e.g. mental component summary score (SF8_mentalcomp*; 0.85) and anxious depression score (BSF_anxdepression; 0.79). Hence, PT 4 was labeled as distress group. PT 4 represents the youngest of the 4 subgroups (avg. ), with the largest fraction of male patients (Table??). % (ref:06-inter-group-socio) Inter-phenotype comparison of demographic characteristics. Summaries are given as means [95% confidence interval] for the whole population and for each of the 4 phenotypes.

Figure 6.5: (ref:06-inter-group-socio) 6.7 Benefits of our method In this study, we combined data-driven clustering with a novel visualisation to identify and display distinct phenotypes in a large sample of patients with chronic tinnitus. % %========================================================================================= Patient data were extracted from self-report questionnaires prior to starting a multimodal treatment program. % %========================================================================================= Our analysis suggests four phenotypes of patients with chronic tinnitus. % %========================================================================================= %========================================================================================= 6.8 Clinical interpretation The three tinnitus experts who co-authored the original paper (Niemann, Brueggemann, Boecking, Rose, et al. 2020) discussed the clincial relevance of the phenotypes. Their interpretation is briefly summarized as follows. PT 1 (avoidant group) represents more than half of the patient sample. Besides the actual tinnitus symptom, patients in this subgroup reported few other affective or psychosomatic symptoms. Because of these patients biased presentation (everything is okay were it not for the tinnitus), clinicians might easily be led to believe that the assessment of potential other contributors to individual distress is unnecessary. However, clinical experience strongly suggests a thorough assessment of broader psychosocial stressors. The psychosocial resourcefulness of this subgroup enables patients to seek help quickly and in a solution-oriented manner. Adequate tinnitus-specific counseling and individualized (online) therapy modules comprising audiological, psychological or relaxation procedures may possibly represent an adequate treatment strategy for this patient subgroup. PT 2 (psychosomatic group) represents 15% of patients with high tinnitus burden and clinically relevant impairment across all affective indices, including depression, anxiety and perceived stress. These affective symptoms appear to strongly interact with somatoform expressions of distress, including physical complaints and somatic symptoms. Patients of these subgroup reported severely reduced quality of life and reduced coping behavior, higher pessimism, less experienced self-efficacy and optimism. There is the frequently asked question as to whether increased tinnitus-related distress contributes to increases in depression or vice versa. In this group, depressive or anxious symptoms may be considered a crucial underlying factor for general symptom burden and treatment must begin by focusing on improving mood and relieving depression. Here, tinnitus-related distress may need to be seen within a broader context of medical and psychological influencing factors that require patient-individual conceptualization. PT 3 (somatic group) appears to represent a patient subgroup that is characterized by somatopsychic symptom expressions, i.e., physical symptoms that may reflect distress and/or underlying medical conditions. To adequately address the needs of this patient subgroup, multimodal interventions may include a proportion of body-oriented procedures such as relaxation exercises or physiotherapy whose effect, however, should be interpreted with regard to both direct and indirect psychological effects (e.g. through increased senses of well-being or others care). Patients in PT 4 (distress group) reported above-average perceived stress, accompanied with physical exhaustion and anxious-depressive mood. This group includes rather younger, employed patients and male patients, who indicated chronic distress, potentially being susceptible to burnout syndrome with subjective reduced mental capacity (hamster wheel), which is used as a description of the life situation even without tinnitus distress. Multimodal therapy should initially focus on stress-regulation techniques, including relaxation or individually tailored behavioral modification approaches. Similar to the highly psychosomatically burdened PT 2, patients in PT 4 could also benefit from longer psychotherapeutic or multimodal treatment procedures (inpatient or rehabilitative). The overview and juxtaposition of all clusters shows that some questionnaires and characteristics contribute a lot to differences among patient phenotypes. % %========================================================================================= In particular, patient phenotypes differ substantially with respect to their coping attitudes, their stress and their perception of quality of life, as well as their tinnitus distress. % %========================================================================================= Some of the questionnaire items separate well among some of the phenotypes, see e.g. the items on perceived pain and complaints. % %========================================================================================= In contrast, patients do not seem to differ in their perception of tinnitus. % %========================================================================================= These contributions of the questionnaires to the phenotypes indicate that phenotyping may be achievable also with less questionnaires, especially because some of the questionnaires are overlapping. % %========================================================================================= %========================================================================================= Previous studies also employed clustering algorithms to identify tinnitus subtypes(Langguth et al. 2017, Tyler:TinnitusClustering2008, vandenBerge2017, Schecklmann:BrainResearch2012). % %========================================================================================= It is difficult to compare our findings to theirs because of the different set of available measurements: whereas the strength of our study was a large pool of self-report questionnaire data, Tyler et al. used both self-report data and audiometrics(Tyler et al. 2008), Schecklmann et al. used self-report data and cordiac imaging features(Schecklmann et al. 2012), and Langguth et al. used audiometric data(Langguth et al. 2017). % Nevertheless, PT 2 (psychosomatic suffering group) appears to match the constant distressing tinnitus'' subgroup reported by Tyler et al.[@Tyler:TinnitusClustering2008], as average scores on features measuring tinnitus-related health burden were distinctly greater than in the other subgroups. % Of course, the selection of meaningful features is pivotal for the efficacy of any cluster analysis. % Schlee et al. argued against the usage of single-item features like visual analogue scale measurements because of their higher susceptibility to random measurement errors, lower test-retest reliability and higher vulnerability to unknown biases[@Schlee:RadarVis2017]. % Due to the exploratory nature of our study, we decided to include both single-item measurements and compound scores. % We assigned 11 out of 15 single-item measurements into the categoryTinnitus characteristics. % Figure?? (top-right) shows their low discriminative power, as all phenotypes means are close to the population average, with the exception of and . %========================================================================================= %========================================================================================= Closest to our radial bar chart visualisation is the radar chart proposed by Schlee and colleagues(Schlee et al. 2017). % Their solution indeed facilitates the comparison of two subgroups by comparing the areas of their associated polygons. % However, there is still the potential problem of overplotting when one wishes to compare more than 2 subgroups as we do. % % https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveat/spider.html Hence, we did not opt to fill up the areas spanned by the connected points with colour, to avoid a polygonal that fully overlays another one. % Further, since the main criterion for comparison is the polygonals shapes, inferences highly depend on the ordering of features around the plot which can be misleading. Schlee et al.(Schlee et al. 2017) tackled this problem by computing an ordering that yields areas that achieve maximum mean surface difference between subgroups and minimum surface variance within subgroups. % This approach is feasible for up to a moderate ($$20) number of features. % In our study with 64 features, we decided to arrange features based on semantic categories, e.g. quality of life. % This allows to detect and track features easier. % Further, our visualisation is not specific to tinnitus but could be used to present a compact visual summary of characteristics of any condition or index symptoms subgroups. % Whether the visualisations will be adopted by clinicians for finding suitable tinnitus management strategies needs to be tested. % % % Preliminarily, clinicians suggested that graphical summaries of possible patient subtypes may alleviate allocation of modular treatment strategies to specific combinations of symptom presentations. % % In a preliminary evaluation, the clinicians % signalized that such a graphical summary of test results for the patient allows for a % faster and more efficient diagnostic comparison of the clinical examination with the test % results. % % Furthermore, the patient can be better addressed with respect to possible contradictions % or gaps in the anamnesis. % % This benefits above all the consultation and the individual planning of therapy modules, % because multimodal approaches to tinnitus therapy are not available everywhere. % % %========================================================================================= %========================================================================================= % %========================================================================================= A potential limitation of our analysis is the exclusion of patients who did not fill all questionnaires during admission. % There are several reasons why a patient may not have filled all questionnaires, including unfamiliarity with the technical devices (the questionnaires must be filled electronically), loss of motivation due to the relatively large number of questionnaires and collision with baseline examinations in the lab. % The exclusion of these patients may have led to a selection bias. % Nonetheless, our analysis over all 15 questionnaires allowed us to acquire insights to the contribution of these questionnaires to phenotyping, so that eventually a reduction of questionnaires might become possible. % Further, our analysis is a static snapshot of phenotypes at baseline. Hence, it might be sensitive to possible changes in tinnitus perception and associated health burden over time. % It is possible that a patient will transition from one phenotype to another in later stages of her life or depending on her tinnitus management. % Thus, a next step would be to study the effects of treatment to these phenotypes and find whether some patient phenotypes benefit more than others. % Another limitation comes from the heuristic choice of the number of phenotypes. % %========================================================================================= The radar plot in figure?? shows average scores for each variable and for all clusters. % %========================================================================================= While the four phenotypes are clearly distinguishable with respect to the psychosomatic and somatic variables, the line segments for most features of the group ``tinnitus characteristics are close to the overall patient average. % %========================================================================================= % Place tables after the first paragraph in which they are cited. In Subsection 2.6.4, we described challenges for management and treatment of tinnitus due to its clinical heterogeneity. Similar studies argue that patient stratification may contribute to the development of suitable and effective treatment strategies. Since clinically relevant subgroups are not yet established, clustering has been identified as a promising approach to identify distinct tinnitus phenotypes in a hypothesis-free way. There is no concensus on which tinnitus measurements should be used for data-driven subgrouping. For example, previous studies performed cluster analysis based on a small number of audiometric features ??, a combination of features extracted from self-reports, audiometry and psychoacoustics ??, or neuroimaging data and socio-demographics??. xxAlthough each of these studies provided insights in tinnitus subgroup patterns acceptance among medical practitioners might be increased by presenting the clustering results with intuitive visualizations that show individual subgroup patterns and enable the visual juxtaposition of multiple subgroups with respect to multi-variate data. In this context, Schlee et al. proposed a compact radar chart visualization that allows to juxtapose the degree of health burden either between individuals or between subgroups based on multi-variate data??. While their visualization could be applied to any disease domain, Schlee et al. demonstrated its efficacy showing subgroup differences with respect to measurements of tinnitus distress and associated comorbidities. However, Schlee et al. did not aim to visualize clustering results, but restricted themselves to pre-defined cohorts by graphically comparing female against male patients or patients with low tinnitus frequency against patients with high tinnitus frequency. Hence, the goal of this study is to combine clustering for tinnitus phenotyping with visual cluster representation and juxtaposition. Firstly, we performed cluster analysis and identified distinct phenotypes in patients with chronic tinnitus based on 64 variables extracted from self-report questionnaires. Secondly, we created an intuitive radial chart visualization to display multi-variate characteristics of a single cluster, and to facilitate comparison of multiple clusters. % The goals of this study were (a) to determine an optimal number of phenotypes, (b) to identify features and feature-value ranges that characterize each phenotype, (c) to identify groups of features with similar patterns across clusters and (d) to visualize clusters in an intuitive and interpretable way.

Tinnitus is a worldwide health problem, with prevalence rates ranging between 12% and 30%~(McCormack et al. 2015). Besides potential hearing loss~(Martines et al. 2010), chronic tinnitus is frequently associated with concomitant psychological difficulties, including depression(Zirke et al. 2013, Zoeger:TinitusPsychatric2006, Trevis:TinnitusReview2018), anxiety~(McCormack et al. 2015, Zoeger:TinitusPsychatric2006), other somatoform disorders~(Andersson 2002, Hiller:Somatoform1997) and insomnia~(WallhÃ¤usser-Franke, Schredl, and Delb 2013). % Upon presenting at an outpatient clinic, patients with (chronic) tinnitus undergo comprehensive medical and psychological assessments that inform individual case conceptualizations and treatment planning. % Whilst complex psychobiological interactions are known to contribute to tinnitus-related distress in chronified presentations, reliable and valid assessment procedures can be time-consuming and cumbersome. % To reduce patient burden without compromising on assessment validity, it is thus desirable to identify and measure selected key features of tinnitus-related distress. % % At first visit to an outpatient clinic, tinnitus patients usually undergo several medical test and complete multiple questionnaires to gather information on tinnitus-related distress, loudness and frequency as well as associated complications. Subsequently, clinicians analyze the questionnaire answers to derive patient-tailored treatment pathways with best-possible prospect of treatment efficacy. % % Although many well-established questionnaire (sub-)scales provide guidance, the final diagnosis of tinnitus severity is still based on the subjective assessment of the clinician. % % Furthermore, the accuracy of these scales is dependent on the veracity of the patients answers. % % This may be questionable since completing multiple lengthy questionnaires can be tedious and cumbersome. % % Consequently, the therapy decision made by the clinician may not be optimal. % % Thus, an accurate, objective tinnitus severity model is required for an improved therapy planning. % % Further, this model should only use the most relevant questions. % % Ultimately, the knowledge of relevant and irrelevant questions can be used to reduce the overall amount of questions within a questionnaire. % The present paper addresses the following research questions: % \\begin{enumerate}[label=Q] % To what extent do features recorded during registration allow for a prediction of tinnitus-related distress after treatment? % Which features are predictive of tinnitus-related distress before and after treatment completion? % How many features recorded during registration are really necessary for a good prediction of tinnitus-related distress after treatment? % % \\end{enumerate} % We build up on the the workflow we proposed in~(Niemann et al. 2019), which encompasses data preparation steps, machine learning algorithms for the separation of relevant and irrelevant depression in tinnitus patients, as well as an iteratively invoked module that reduces the feature space while sustaining separation quality. %========================================================================================= Analyses were based on data from patients with chronic tinnitus who had been treated at the Tinnitus Center of CharitÃ© UniversitÃ¤tsmedizin Berlin, Germany, between January 2011 and October 2015. % Treatment comprised an intensive, multimodal 7-day program that included informational counselling, detailed ear-nose-throat (ENT) as well as medical and psychological diagnostics, cognitive-behaviour therapy interventions, auditory training, relaxation exercises, and physiotherapy. % Ethical approval was granted by CharitÃ© Universitaetsmedizin Berlin ethics committee (reference number EA1/115/15). % All relevant guidelines and regulations were followed. % All patients gave informed written consent for data collection. % Prior to the analyses, all data had been anonymised.% %========================================================================================= For clustering, a total of 64 features from 14 questionnaires was used, comprising 49 compound scores and 15 single-item measurements: %subscale scores, total scores and single 3 items%and sociodemographic information from % questionnaires: %unter UmstÃ¤nden tatsÃ¤chlich die FragebÃ¶gen nach Gruppen sortieren (total scores: x,y,z; % subscale scores: a,b,c; and sociodemographics? %========================================================================================= %========================================================================================= % Additionally, the patient age was recorded. % 4,103 % In total, the baseline recordings (T0) of 1,228 patients who completed % all of these questionnaires were used for clustering. % % Additionally, for of these patients (80.5%) post-treatment % recordings (T1) were also available and used to visually explore treatment effect % differences between clusters. % Since all features of the SF8 and some features of the BSF, SWOP and PSQ have higher scores with better quality of life, features with a positive wording were reversed (new value = maximum feature value \\(-\\) old value) so that the interpretation (higher scores represent higher burden) remained consistent. % Hereafter, feature names with a *-suffix denote reversed features. % Due to widely differing value ranges, each feature was standardised prior to cluster analysis via z-score normalisation to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. % %========================================================================================= %========================================================================================= To identify a distinct set of tinnitus phenotypes, the clustering algorithm X-means was employed(Pelleg, Moore, and others 2000). % X-means is a parameter-free extension of the popular \\(K\\)-means clustering algorithm that incorporates the Bayesian Information Criterion(Schwarz and others 1978) (BIC) to automatically find an appropriate number of clusters \\(K\\) by finding a good trade-off between high goodness of fit and a low number of clusters. % Let \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) be the dataset with \\(d\\) dimensions and \\(D\\) a subset of \\(\\mathcal{D}\\), i.e., \\(D\\subseteq \\mathcal{D}\\). % A \\(K\\)-means clustering on \\(D\\) yields the set of clusters \\(\\mathcal{C}=\\left\\{C_1,\\ldots,C_k,\\ldots,C_K\\right\\}\\), where \\(c_k\\) is the centroid of cluster \\(k\\), \\(r_k\\) is the number of points in \\(D\\) assigned to \\(c_k\\) and \\(p\\) is the number of free parameters, i.e., % \\(p = (K-1) + d \\cdot K + 1\\) \\(p = (d+1) \\cdot K\\). % (d+1) K??? The BIC of a cluster \\(C_k\\) using Schwarz criterion is calculated as \\(\\text{BIC}(C_k) = \\hat{l}_k(\\mathcal{D}) - \\frac{p_k}{2} \\cdot \\log |\\mathcal{D}|\\), where \\(\\hat{l}_k(\\mathcal{D})\\) is the log-likelihood of \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) according to \\(C_k\\). % The point probabilities are computed as \\(\\hat{P}(x_i)=\\frac{r_{(i)}}{|\\mathcal{D}|}\\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\hat{\\sigma}}\\text{exp}\\left(\\-\\frac{1}{2\\hat{\\sigma}^2}||x_i-c_{(i)}||\\right)\\), where the maximum likelihood estimate for the variance (under the identical spherical Gaussian assumption) is \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2=\\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{D}|-K}\\sum_{i=1}^{|\\mathcal{D}|}\\left(x_i - \\mu_{(i)}\\right)^2\\). % The log-likelihood of \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) according to \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) is \\(l(\\mathcal{D})=\\log\\prod_{i=1}^{|\\mathcal{D}|} P(x_i)=\\sum_{i=1}^{|\\mathcal{D}|}\\left(\\log \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\hat{\\sigma}} - \\frac{1}{2 \\sigma^2} ||x_i-c_{(i)}||^2 + \\log \\frac{r_{(i)}}{|\\mathcal{D}|} \\right)\\). % %========================================================================================= % the BIC of a clustering \\(C_k\\) with \\(K=k\\) is calculated as % \\[BIC(C_k,D) = \\hat{l}(D,C_k) - \\frac{p_k}{2}\\log m\\], % where \\(\\hat{l}(D,C_k)\\) is the log-likelihood of the data w.r.t. \\(C_k\\) and \\(p_k\\) is the number of parameters, \\(p_k=(k-1)+nk+1\\). % Let \\(D_j\\) be the subset of points that is assigned to the \\(j\\)-th centroid, with \\(j\\in 1,\\ldots, k\\), and \\(r=|D_j|\\). % The maximum likelihood estimate for the variance, under the identical spherical Gaussian assumption, is: % \\[\\hat{\\sigma}^2=\\frac{1}{r-k}\\sum_{i\\in 1,\\ldots,r}(x_i-\\mu_i)^2\\]. % The log-likelihood \\(\\hat{l}(D,C_k)\\) is calculated as % \\[\\hat{l}(D,C_k)=-\\frac{N_k}{2}\\log(2\\pi)-\\frac{N_kd}{2}\\log(\\hat{\\sigma}^2)-\\frac{N_k-K}{2}+N_k\\log N_k-N_k\\log N\\] %========================================================================================= The X-means algorithm consists of 4 steps: % (1)~First, an initial K-means is run with \\(K=K_{lower}\\). % (2)~Then each centroid is bisected into two children which are placed in opposite directions along a randomly chosen vector. % (3)~A ``local 2-means clustering is run for each pair of children and a BIC score is assigned to this new partitioning. % % They are moved a distance proportional to the size of the region in opposite directions along a randomly chosen vector. % (4)~If the BIC score increases with bisection of a centroid, the respective child centroids are kept, otherwise, the parent centroid is kept. % Steps (2)-(4) are repeated until neither centroids BIC score can be improved by bisection. % We used the R implementation of the X-means algorithm of Ishioka and set \\(K_{lower}\\) to 2(Ishioka 2005). % Numbering of clusters as cluster 1, cluster 2, etc. was done arbitrarily. %========================================================================================= %========================================================================================= Visualisation of clusters in high dimensionality is challenging. % %========================================================================================= The popular scatterplot matrices (SPLOMs) and their extensions intuitively represent the relation between pairs of features as matrix where each non-diagonal element is a two-dimensional scatterplot(Im, McGuffin, and Leung 2013, Klemm:RegressionHeatmap2015). % %========================================================================================= However, the number of scatterplots grows quadratically with increasing dimensionality which leads to scalability problems such as overplotting. %========================================================================================= Hence, advanced visualisation techniques have been proposed as a remedy, e.g. density contours, hexagon binning, coloring, transparency, layers showing aggregated geometric characteristics (minimal spanning trees, alpha shape, convex hull), animation, or combinations of multiple techniques such as splatterplots(Mayorga and Gleicher 2013). % % class-specific smoothed density contours %========================================================================================= Still, SPLOMs and other traditional visualization techniques such as parallel coordinate charts(Hartigan 1975) are more suited for rather low-dimensional data with only a handful of features. %========================================================================================= %========================================================================================= In case the original data cannot be adequately displayed on low-dimensional projections, dimensionality reduction (DR) is often applied as preprocessing step in advance of visualisation. % %========================================================================================= DR algorithms transform a high-dimensional feature space onto a low-dimensional (often 2D) projection. % %========================================================================================= Ideally, the projection preserves important structures of the original data, such as clusters, outliers, correlations and other important structures. % %========================================================================================= Principal component analysis (PCA) is a frequently used DR algorithm that generates a new coordinate system with orthogonal dimensions~(Hotelling 1933). % %========================================================================================= The new dimensions (principal components, PC) are linear combinations of the original dimensions and are sorted according to variance. % %========================================================================================= Each PC carries a loading that characterises how much variability of the data is explained. % %========================================================================================= PCA is primarily suited for normally distributed data. % %========================================================================================= However, PCA has problems with outliers and is incapable of capturing non-linear relationships. % %========================================================================================= Another popular DR algorithm is multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) which puts emphasis on preserving distance. % %========================================================================================= Points that are close in high-dimensional space should also be close in low-dimensional space. % %========================================================================================= For complex (arbitrarily-shaped) structures, large distance is meaningless because of the curse of dimensionality, thus results may be unsatisfactory. % %========================================================================================= \\(t\\)-stochastic neighbourhood embedding (\\(t\\)-SNE) is a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique that visualises a matrix of pairwise-similarities(Maaten and Hinton 2008). % %========================================================================================= The similarities are calculated in a way to both preserve global structures (clusters at different scales) and local structures (distances and neighbours). % %========================================================================================= \\(t\\)-SNE does not allow for interpretation of the original dimensions. % %========================================================================================= Further, the technique does not support to add a new observation to the existing projection without recalculation. % %========================================================================================= %========================================================================================= DR techniques cannot be applied here because even if the clustering structure is preserved in the data projection, the semantics of the original features will be lost. Discussions with domain experts led to the following requirements for a cluster visualisation: %========================================================================================= %========================================================================================= We therefore introduce a new radial bar chart visualisation as graphical representation of a single cluster, enriched with dedicated elements that satisfy the aforementioned requirements. % In particular, the height of a bar depicts the average value of a feature over the patients assigned to that cluster. % The radial spatial layout distributes the bars around a circle where each bar starts at the black 0 line which represents the feature average over all patients included in this study. % Due to the scaling (z-score normalisation) of the features, bars inclined to the outside represent feature averages above the overall patient mean and bars inclined to the inside represent feature averages below the overall patient mean. % This interpretation is visually supported by colour-coded bars using a sequential gradient from dark blue (low burden) to yellow (mean burden) to bright red (high burden). % Feature names are shown on top of each bar. % % The black outer lines highlight the 0-point representing the population average, a value of 1 represents one standard deviation above the population average. All values are depicted in terms of standard deviation away from the mean. % For example, a value of $-$1 indicates that the cluster average is 1 standard deviation smaller than the overall patient average. % Intra-cluster standard deviation are represented as grey error lines facing the coloured inner circle. % % Grey inward lines represent the intra-cluster standard deviation. To facilitate quick feature localisation, features were grouped into categories which are displayed in the inner circle, alongside the cluster name and the number of patients assigned to that cluster. % These categories were (in clockwise order): %socio-demographics, % tinnitus characteristics, physical quality of life, %somatic quality of life, experiences of pain, %somatic pain, somatic expressions, affective symptoms, %psychological symptoms, tinnitus-related distress, %psychological tinnitus distress, internal resources, %psychological attitudinal factors, perceived stress, and %psychological stress, and mental %psychological quality of life. % % %========================================================================================= %========================================================================================= To provide a graphical overview of all clusters at the same time, we designed a radar chart variant where feature averages are represented as points instead of bars which allows to show multiple clusters. % Within each feature category, the points of a cluster are connected by line segments. % Points and line segments are coloured by cluster. % %========================================================================================= % % Although clustering was performed on baseline data only, we decided to explore treatment effects to visually discover potential cluster-specific idiosyncrasies. % For this purpose, we extend the radial bar chart by showing both pre-treatment and post-treatment averages as bars placed next to each other. % The ends of a pair of bars are connected by a line with an arrow-head pointing to the bar of the post-treatment score. % To highlight large treatment effect magnitudes, connecting lines and feature labels are colored in green (decrease by min. \\(\\Delta\\cdot\\) SD from T0 to T1), red (increase by \\(\\Delta\\cdot\\) SD) or black (no considerable change), respectively. %========================================================================================= To provide a graphical overview, an interactive demo of the cluster solutions and the visualisations is available under . % % . % Radar charts were augmented with interactive components: by hovering over a bar or a feature label, additional cluster summaries and compact feature descriptions are shown as tooltips. % Clicking on a feature invokes an additional chart which shows the (normalised) distribution of the selected feature stratified by cluster, and if selected, also after treatment. % Continuous features are shown using semi-transparent boxplots placed on violin plot (Hintze and Nelson 1998) layers whereas for nominal features, category proportions alongside their 95% confidence intervals are displayed as points and error lines, respectively. % %========================================================================================= %========================================================================================= Kruskal-Wallis test was used for statistical comparison of inter-phenotype differences for continuous features (like age), and Pearsons chi-squared test was used for categorical features (like gender). % Differences were considered significant if p$&lt;$0.05. % Correction for multiple comparison was not conducted due to the exploratory nature of the study. % Confidence intervals for the means were estimated using %exact Binomial test for proportion features and nonparametric basic bootstrap sampling (Davison and Hinkley 1997) with 2,000 samples, respectively. % %========================================================================================= % % % % Beyond a small number of phenotypes, it is vital to understand the general variability of local patterns among tinnitus patients. % For this purpose, a self-organizing map (SOM) was trained on the dataset. % The SOM algorithm creates a one- or two-dimensional manifold in the feature space, called topological map. % The goal is to build a relationship-preserving topology, where objects which are similar in the original high-dimensional feature space are close together in the projection. % Actual distance magnitudes are disregarded. % Unlike other popular dimension reduction algorithms such as principal component analysis~(Hotelling 1933), multi-dimensional scaling~(Kruskal 1964) and t-stochastic neighborhood embedding~(Maaten and Hinton 2008), SOMs map objects to discrete (grid) positions in the low-dimensional manifold of the feature space. % These so called units (or nodes) are associated with a codebook vector, which corresponds to the average of all objects mapped to that unit and is often referred to as the prototype for the unit, similarly to the centroid in K-means. % A new observation, i.e., an observation that was not used for SOM creation, is mapped to the so called winning unit, the unit with smallest distance between its codebook vector and the observation. % SOM algorithm parameters include grid type (hexagonal or rectangular), % grid dimensions (width and height), % initial learning rate \\(\\alpha_0\\) and initial neighborhood radius \\(\\sigma_0\\). % Briefly, the batch version of the iterative algorithm comprises four steps. % In the initialization step, the weights of each codebook vector \\(w_0(i)\\) are randomly populated. % In the competition step, for a randomly selected observation \\(x\\) in iteration \\(t\\), the winning unit \\(c\\) is determined via a distance function \\(d()\\) as \\(c_t=\\argmin_{i\\in 1,\\ldots,g}d(x,w_t(i))\\), where \\(g\\) is the number of units in the grid. % Often, Euclidean distance is used as distance function, i.e., \\(d(x,y)=\\sqrt{\\sum_{j=1}^m (x_j-y_j)}\\), where \\(m\\) is the number of dimensions of the dataset. % In the cooperation step, all nodes that lie within the neighborhood of \\(c\\) are determined. % The neighborhood radius \\(\\sigma_t\\) gradually decreases with each iteration. % For example, \\(\\sigma_t\\) can be calculated using an exponential neighborhood decay function as \\(\\sigma_t=\\sigma_0\\cdot e^{-\\frac{t}{\\lambda}}\\), where \\(\\lambda\\) is a constant. % Then, the degree in participation of unit \\(i\\) in weight-updating is given as \\(h_t(c,i)=e^{-\\frac{d(c,i)^2}{2\\sigma_t^2}}\\). % In the adaption step, each unit is updated by adjusting the weights towards the selected observation as \\(w_{t+1}(i)=w_i(t)+\\alpha_t h_t(c,i)(x-w_t(i))\\). % Finally, \\(t\\) is incremented and the procedure is repeated from the competition step until the maximum number of iterations \\(T\\) is reached or the change of the weights is less than a predefined threshold. % We used the R package ~(Wehrens and Kruisselbrink 2018) with a hexagonal grid layout, a height and width of 10, a learning rate with linear decrease from \\(\\alpha_0=0.05\\) to \\(\\alpha_T=0.01\\) over \\(T=500\\) iterations with an exponential neighborhood decay function. % % We developed a visualization comparable to variable factor maps which are popular in principal component analysis, where a projection of the original variables onto the the plane spanned by the first two principal components is shown. % This plot serves as an intuitive illustration of the correlation between the original variables and the principal components. % Here, we were interested in displaying the correlation between features and the SOM grid. % More specifically, let \\(x\\) be the vector of x-coordinates of the SOM units, and % \\(w\\) is a weight vector with the number of instances assigned to a node. % Then, \\(\\bar{x}\\) is the weighted mean of the x-coordinate, with \\(\\bar{x}=(\\sum_i w_i\\cdot x_i)/(\\sum_i w_i)\\), and \\(\\bar{v}^f\\) is the weighted mean of the codebook vector with respect to feature \\(f\\), with \\(\\bar{v}^f=(\\sum_i w_i\\cdot v_i^f)/(\\sum_i w_i)\\). The weighted correlation is \\(\\phi=\\frac{\\sum_i (w_i\\cdot(x_i-\\bar{x})\\cdot(v_i^f-\\bar{v}^f))}{\\sqrt{(\\sum_i(w_i\\cdot(x_i-\\bar{x})^2))}\\cdot \\sqrt{(\\sum_i(w_i\\cdot(v_i^f-\\bar{v}^f)^2))}}\\). % We drew the SOM grid augmented with a scatter plot where the position of a point represents the value of \\(\\phi\\) with respect to the x- and y-coordinate for a particular feature. % % It is the SOM grid augmented with a scatter plot which shows for each feature the correlation of the codebook vectors and their position in the grid. % For example, if a point is located at the top-left of the grid, this means that observations in the top-left nodes exhibit high values and observations in the bottom-right nodes exhibit low values for this feature. % Hence, we identified groups of features that correlated with the SOM coordinates and selectively showed their feature heatmaps. %========================================================================================= % According to \\(X\\)-means, four clusters (referred to as phenotypes hereafter) represent an optimal solution for the given dataset. % %========================================================================================= The radial barcharts in figure?? visualise phenotype-individual averages for all features. % %========================================================================================= Graphical summaries of phenotype value distributions for all features on their original scales are provided in Supplementary Fig. S1. % %========================================================================================= The radar plot in figure?? shows average scores for each variable and for all clusters. % %========================================================================================= While the four phenotypes are clearly distinguishable with respect to the psychosomatic and somatic variables, the line segments for most features of the group tinnitus characteristics'' are close to the overall patient average. % %========================================================================================= Phenotype 1 (PT 1) represents the largest subgroup with 697 out of 1,228 patients (56.8\\%). % %========================================================================================= This patient subgroup is characterised by ostensibly below-average symptom expression across tinnitus-related and broader psychosomatic symptom indices, including affective symptoms, perceived stress, tinnitus-related distress and somatic symptoms, as well as (above-average) quality of life and internal resources (figure\\@ref(fig:radial-overview)). % %========================================================================================= Due to their help-seeking behaviour, presentation in clinic and wish to participate in multimodal treatment, it can be assumed that this group of patients do experience psychological distress, however aim to present themselves as healthily as possible. % %========================================================================================= We therefore label this phenotypeavoidant group. % %========================================================================================= Patients in this subgroup feature proportionately high levels of education, employment and low levels of leave of absence and psychotherapeutic treatment (Table??). % %========================================================================================= % Average scores of all psychological symptoms, quality of life, , % subjective stress, tinnitus-related distress, pain and expressions were lowest among all % PTs (figure??). % % Since their average scores for features in the psychological stress and psychological % quality of life categories were particularly low, ranging between $1b.5 to 1.0 SD below % population average, this subgroup showed best coping % despite approx. population-average tinnitus frequency (). % % PT 1 was labeled as , % referring to possibly unrecognized or % perceived psychological restrictions and reduced quality of life. % % Patients of this subgroup appear to avoid self-attribution of limitation and % suffering, but voluntarily went undergone intensive care. % % Among all clusters, PT 1 exhibited the largest proportion of persons with Abitur % (highest German school graduation), the largest proportion of employed persons, the % smallest periods of sick leave and the lowest use of psychotherapeutic treatment, and % these patients reported the shortest time period since tinnitus onset % (Table??). % PT 2 comprised 173 patients (14.1%) who reported the highest emotional and somatic burden among all PTs (figure??~b). % %========================================================================================= More specifically, PT 2 represents a patient subgroup with high psychosomatic-comorbidity and is thus labelled psychosomatic group''. % %========================================================================================= This patient subgroup shows high tinnitus burden alongside clinically relevant impairment across all affective indices including depression, anxiety, and perceived stress. % %========================================================================================= These affective symptoms appear to align with somatoform expressions of distress including somatic symptoms. % %========================================================================================= Patients of these subgroup report severely reduced quality of life and reduced coping opportunities with more pessimism, less experienced self-efficacy and optimism. % %========================================================================================= Patients in this subgroup feature a high proportion of patients who live alone, are unemployed or show an overall lower educational status. % %========================================================================================= Patients in this cluster further appear to consult more doctors, take more leave of absence and use more psychotherapy. % %========================================================================================= PT 2 patients reported the tinnitus sound to be audible in the entire head to a greater portion than the other groups. % %========================================================================================= % average scores for 52 out of 53 psychological and somatic variables were % at least 0.5 standard deviations (SD) above the overall patient mean % (cf. figure\\@ref(fig:radial-overview)~B). % % Among the variables with the highest average scores were \\textsf{ISR\\_totalpsychiatricsyn} % (1.55; ICD-10 psychiatric symptome rating score), % \\textsf{ADSL\\_depression} (1.51), % \\textsf{BSF\\_anxiousdepression} (1.51), % \\textsf{ISR\\_additionalitems} (1.50), % ISR\\_depression (1.49) and % PHQK\\_depression (1.49). % % Hence, this PT was labeled \\emph{psychosomatic group}. % % PT 2 patients reported the tinnitus sound to be audible in the entire head % (\\textsf{TLQ\\_01\\_entirehead}) to a greater portion (27.4\\%) than the other groups. % % This subgroup had diametrically opposed socio-demographic characteristics to PT 1, i.e., % lowest Abitur and employment percentages, as well as highest sick times and use of % psychotherapeutic treatment among all phenotypes. % PT 3 contained 187 associated patients (15.2\\%) characterised by above-average scores of features measuring somatic complaints and near-average scores for affective symptoms (figure\\@ref(fig:radial-overview)~c). % %========================================================================================= Since pain scores of \\textsf{SF8\\_bodilyhealth*} and \\textsf{SSKAL\\_painfrequency} were similarly large as PT2, this patient subset was labelledsomatic group. % %========================================================================================= PT 3 represented the oldest subgroup, with the largest proportion of female patients and largest reported time period since tinnitus onset. % %========================================================================================= Unlike PT3, PT 4 (n=171; 13.9%) exhibited above-average scores for affective scores, components of quality of life and perceived stress (figure??~d), e.g. mental component summary score (; 0.85) and anxious depression score (; 0.79). % %========================================================================================= Hence, we label PT 4 as ``distress group. % %========================================================================================= PT 4 comprises the youngest of the 4 subgroups, with the largest fraction of male patients (Table??). %

Schlee et al.(Schlee et al. 2017) tackled this problem by computing an ordering that yields areas that achieve maximum mean surface difference between subgroups and minimum surface variance within subgroups. % This approach is feasible for up to a moderate ($$20) number of features. % In our study with 64 features, we decided to arrange features based on semantic categories, e.g. quality of life. % This allows to detect and track features easier. % Further, our visualisation is not specific to tinnitus but could be used to present a compact visual summary of characteristics of any condition or index symptoms subgroups. % Whether the visualisations will be adopted by clinicians for finding suitable tinnitus management strategies needs to be tested. % % % Preliminarily, clinicians suggested that graphical summaries of possible patient subtypes may alleviate allocation of modular treatment strategies to specific combinations of symptom presentations. % % In a preliminary evaluation, the clinicians % signalized that such a graphical summary of test results for the patient allows for a % faster and more efficient diagnostic comparison of the clinical examination with the test % results. % % Furthermore, the patient can be better addressed with respect to possible contradictions % or gaps in the anamnesis. % % This benefits above all the consultation and the individual planning of therapy modules, % because multimodal approaches to tinnitus therapy are not available everywhere. % % %========================================================================================= %========================================================================================= % %========================================================================================= A potential limitation of our analysis is the exclusion of patients who did not fill all questionnaires during admission. % There are several reasons why a patient may not have filled all questionnaires, including unfamiliarity with the technical devices (the questionnaires must be filled electronically), loss of motivation due to the relatively large number of questionnaires and collision with baseline examinations in the lab. % The exclusion of these patients may have led to a selection bias. % Nonetheless, our analysis over all 15 questionnaires allowed us to acquire insights to the contribution of these questionnaires to phenotyping, so that eventually a reduction of questionnaires might become possible. % Further, our analysis is a static snapshot of phenotypes at baseline. Hence, it might be sensitive to possible changes in tinnitus perception and associated health burden over time. % It is possible that a patient will transition from one phenotype to another in later stages of her life or depending on her tinnitus management. % Thus, a next step would be to study the effects of treatment to these phenotypes and find whether some patient phenotypes benefit more than others. % Another limitation comes from the heuristic choice of the number of phenotypes. % References "],["evo.html", "Chapter 8 Constructing Evolution Features to Capture Change over Time 8.1 Motivation and Comparison with Related Work 8.2 Overview of the Mining Workflow 8.3 Generating Evolution Features 8.4 Experiments and Findings 8.5 Benefits of our Method", " Chapter 8 Constructing Evolution Features to Capture Change over Time Based on: (Niemann et al. 2015) 8.1 Motivation and Comparison with Related Work Exploitation of temporal information in medicine and healthcare is often observed, foremostly in the analysis of patient records in healthcare applications. For example, Pechenizkiy et al. analyzed streams of recordings to predict whether a patient will need a re-hospitalization after a health failure treatment (Pechenizkiy et al. 2010). Patient monitoring was also the application area of (Sun et al. 2010), where the emphasis was on computing the similarity between streams of patients for prediction. Combi et al. reported both on the study of streams, e.g. on streams of life signals, and on the temporal analysis of the timestamped medical records of hospital patients (Combi, Keravnou-Papailiou, and Shahar 2010). Patient evolution with clustering was studied in (Siddiqui et al. 2014): Siddiqui et al. proposed a method that predicts the evolution of a patient from timestamped data by clustering them on similarity and predicting cluster movement in the multi-dimensional space. However, the patient data considered in (Siddiqui et al. 2014) are labeled at each moment. A general approach of extracting temporal information is to augment the feature space with variables capturing how individuals evolve over time (Orphanou, Stassopoulou, and Keravnou 2014; A. Singh et al. 2015; Zhao et al. 2017). These approaches include deriving summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, etc.) from the whole time-series, cutting time-series into small windows before computing aggregations, building separate models for each of the windows which are later combined to an ensemble classifier, or generating shapelets to improve classification accuracy. For example, Karlsson et al. introduced a framework for the extraction of shapelets from (medical) time-series which are fed into a random forest classifier that uses shapelets as attribute-test conditions instead of regular features (Karlsson, Papapetrou, and BostrÃ¶m 2016). While these approaches are promising for medical time-series with a large number of observations for each individual and only numerical features, they are not applicable for our SHIP and Dan-MONICA data which comprise only three measurement time-points, contain both continuous and categorical features and where the outcome is measured only in the last wave. There is few work on using temporal information in longitudinal cohort study data with less than 10 waves, although insights from these models could contribute to identify subpopulations that exhibit early signs for an emerging disease, so that timely countermeasures could be initiated. However, with the increasing popularity of deep learning and its many hailed success stories, an alternative to the tedious feature engineering could be the application of deep neuronal networks which automatically construct multiple layers of meta-features that reflect complex non-linear interactions between input features from multiple time points. While these methods often outperform more traditional approaches, they produce so called black-box models which are harder to interpret and communicate to a medical expert. For example, in handwriting and speech recognition, it is not important to understand why a digit is identified as a 2 rather than a 7 or an audio sample is recognized as tail instead of tale, as long as the model is accurate. In contrast, for medical applications it is crucial to understand the reasoning behind a model in order to trust its decision which can have substantial impact on the patients life quality. 8.2 Overview of the Mining Workflow 8.3 Generating Evolution Features 8.4 Experiments and Findings 8.5 Benefits of our Method References "],["diabfoot.html", "Chapter 9 Feature Extraction From Short Temporal Sequences for Clustering 9.1 Motivation and Comparison with Related Work 9.2 Overview of the Mining Workflow 9.3 Experiments and Findings 9.4 Benefits of our Method", " Chapter 9 Feature Extraction From Short Temporal Sequences for Clustering 9.1 Motivation and Comparison with Related Work Based on: (Niemann, Spiliopoulou, Samland, et al. 2016; Niemann, Spiliopoulou, Szczepanski, et al. 2016; Niemann, Spiliopoulou, et al. 2020) 9.2 Overview of the Mining Workflow 9.3 Experiments and Findings 9.4 Benefits of our Method References "],["iml.html", "Chapter 10 Post-hoc Interpretation of Classification Models 10.1 Motivation and Comparison with Related Work 10.2 Overview of the Mining Workflow 10.3 Experiments and Findings on IAD 10.4 Experiments and findings on TPD 10.5 Benefits of our Method", " Chapter 10 Post-hoc Interpretation of Classification Models Based on: (Niemann et al. 2018; Niemann, Brueggemann, Boecking, Mazurek, et al. 2020; Niemann, Boecking, Brueggemann, Mebus, et al. 2020; Niemann, Boecking, Brueggemann, Mazurek, et al. 2020) 10.1 Motivation and Comparison with Related Work For medical applications, it is essential for the epidemiological expert to be able to identify the features and feature-value pairs that are most important with respect to the model decision. Gaining actionable insights of a model beyond accuracy is important in order to derive hypotheses on the interaction between potential risk factors and a target outcome. A few of the widely used algorithms are intrinsic interpretable (Lipton 2015), including linear regression, logistic regression and decision trees. In linear regression, the beta coefficient of a predictor variable denotes the difference in the predicted value of the response variable for an increase of 1 unit of the predictor, given all other predictors stay the same. Similarly, the coefficients of a logistic regression model can be interpreted in terms of change of odds for the positive outcome of the response, again given all other predictors stay the same. Decision trees can achieve higher accuracy than linear and logistic regression, in particular for axes-parallel decision boundaries. The tree structure of the model allows for an intuitive visualization and by transposing interpretable classification rules in form of {IF \\(x \\leq v1\\) AND \\(y&gt;v_2\\) THEN outcome = positive} can be extracted. However, intrinsically interpretable models are often too simple to deal with complex non-linear feature interactions. Thus, more sophisticated algorithms yielding higher accuracy have become more popular, including support vector machines (Boser, Guyon, and Vapnik 1992), gradient boosted trees (Friedman 2001) and, in particular, deep neural networks (Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville 2016). The superior classification performance comes with a cost though: they lack internal mechanisms for direct model interpretation. To provide a trade-off between high accuracy and model transparency, methods for post-hoc explanations and visualizations have been proposed as remedy. One of the most popular model-specific interpretation method is the random forest feature importance which makes use of the instances not sampled for the induction of a single tree, the out-of-bag (OOB) instances (Breiman 2001). First, the model error is measured on the OOB data. Then, the values of each predictor in the OOB data are randomly shuffled at a time and the model error is measured again. The assumption is that the more important a predictor is for the model, the more the error will increase if its values are shuffled. Finally, the difference between the two errors is calculated and averaged over all trees in the forest to yield a feature importance ranking. For neural networks, several scores exist that aggregate the connection weights of all internal and output units that originate from a specific input characterizing a predictor variable (Olden, Joy, and Death 2004). Model-agnostic methods have been proposed to provide algorithm-independent post-hoc explanations and hence, a trade-off between high accuracy and model interpretability. LIME (Ribeiro, Singh, and Guestrin 2016) is a framework for local model-agnostic explanations of an arbitrary classifier. For example, if a medical doctor uses a model to classify a patient of interest as low-risk or high-risk patient, he might be not only interested in the classifier decision but also in identifying which characteristics contributed most to the decision, i.e., whether laboratory values, socio-demographics or rather genetic markers have highest impact. For a complex black-box model, LIME learns a surrogate model to find explanations for the decision of the model for a specific instance of interest \\(i\\). A surrogate model is an interpretable model, e.g. a linear model or a decision tree, that is used to derive a ranking of feature value importance w.r.t. the classification decision of the model on \\(i\\). The procedure of LIME is as follows: First, a new dataset is created by random sampling from the training set weighted by the proximity to the instance of interest. The new dataset is applied on the complex model to obtain predictions. Then, the decision boundary of the local dataset is approximated by a simple model. The authors suggest Lasso regression to find the \\(k\\) most important features for the local model. 10.2 Overview of the Mining Workflow 10.3 Experiments and Findings on IAD 10.4 Experiments and findings on TPD 10.5 Benefits of our Method References "],["summary.html", "Chapter 11 Conclusion and Future Work 11.1 Research Results for Medical Expert-guided Knowledge Discovery 11.2 Future Work", " Chapter 11 Conclusion and Future Work 11.1 Research Results for Medical Expert-guided Knowledge Discovery 11.2 Future Work "],["references.html", "References", " References "],["abbreviations.html", "Abbreviations", " Abbreviations AI Artificial Intelligence DM Data Mining ML Machine Learning "],["appx-pheno.html", "A Appendix A - List of variables for phenotyping", " A Appendix A - List of variables for phenotyping ACSA_qualityoflife*: Quality of life during the last 2 weeks ADSL_depression: Depressive disorder sum score BI_abdominalsymptoms: Abdominal symptoms score BI_fatigue: Fatigue score BI_heartsymptoms: Heart symptoms score BI_limbpain: Limb pain score BI_overallcomplaints: Overall complaints sum score BSF_anger: Anger score BSF_anxdepression: Anxious depression score BSF_apathy: Apathy score BSF_elevatedmood*: Elevated mood score BSF_fatigue: Fatigue score BSF_mindset*: Positive mindset score ISR_additionalitems: Additional items score ISR_anxiety: Anxiety score ISR_compulsivesyn: Obsessive-compulsive syndrome score ISR_depression: Depression score ISR_eatingdisorder: Eating disorder score ISR_somatosyn: Somatoform syndrome score ISR_totalpsychiatricsyn: Total psychiatric syndrom score PHQK_depression: Presence of depression PHQK_panicsyn: Presence of panic syndrome PSQ_demand: Demand score PSQ_joy*: Joy score PSQ_stress: Total perceived stress sum score PSQ_tension: Tension score PSQ_worries: Worries score SES_affectivepain: Affective pain SES_sensoricpain: Sensoric pain SF8_bodilyhealth*: Bodily health score SF8_mentalcomp*: Mental component summary score SF8_mentalhealth*: Mental health score SF8_overallhealth*: Overall health score SF8_physicalcomp*: Physical component summary score SF8_physicalfunct*: Physical functioning score SF8_roleemotional*: Role emotional score SF8_rolephysical*: Role physical score SF8_socialfunct*: Social functioning score SF8_vitality*: Vitality score SSKAL_painfrequency: Visual analog scale pain frequency SSKAL_painimpairment: Visual analog scale pain impairment SSKAL_painseverity: Visual analog scale pain severity SWOP_optimism*: Optimism score SWOP_pessimism: Pessimism score SWOP_selfefficacy*: Self-efficacy score TINSKAL_frequency: Tinnitus frequency TINSKAL_impairment: Tinnitus impairment TINSKAL_loudness: Tinnitus loudness TLQ_01_bothears: Tinnitus location: both ears TLQ_01_entirehead: Tinnitus location: entire head TLQ_01_leftear: Tinnitus location: left ear TLQ_01_rightear: Tinnitus location: right ear TLQ_02_hissing: Tinnitus noise: hissing TLQ_02_ringing: Tinnitus noise: ringing TLQ_02_rustling: Tinnitus noise: rustling TLQ_02_whistling: Tinnitus noise: whistling TQ_auditoryperceptdiff: Auditory perceptual difficulties score TQ_cognitivedistress: Cognitive distress score TQ_distress: Total tinnitus distress score TQ_emodistress: Emotional distress score TQ_intrusiveness: Intrusiveness score TQ_psychodistress: Psychological distress score TQ_sleepdisturbances: Sleep disturbances score TQ_somacomplaints: Somatic complaints score "],["bookdown-tutorial.html", "Bookdown tutorial", " Bookdown tutorial custom (sub-)section label: {#id} citation: [@PechenizkiyEtAl:CBMS10] reference to figure or table: \\@ref(tab:cha_questionnaires) reference to (sub-)section: \\@ref(cha) custom label outside of code chunk header: figures: (ref:04_prospector) xxx tables: Table: (#tab:03-costmatrix) replace LaTex references with bookdown references replace ~?\\ref{(.*?)} with \\(ref?)(\\1) replace LaTex citations with bookdown citations replace \\cite{(.*?)} with [@\\1] "]]
