<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 3</span> Medical Background</h1>
<p>Typical goals of medical research include identifying long-term determinants and protective factors for an outcome of interest, discovering sub-populations with increased disease prevalence, studying intervention effects by generating statistical (causal) models that explain cause-effect relationships.</p>
<!--- discover and describe the statistical (causal) relationship between certain factors (genetic abnormalities, pollutants, lifestyle, drugs or medical treatment) on the one hand and certain subsequent health changes, such as illness, improvement or recovery on the other (wiki)-->
<p>Traditional data analysis pipelines are usually structured as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A medical scholar formulates a hypothesis based on observations in clinical practice or current research. Examples: how does a risk factor like alcohol abuse affects the prevalence of a certain outcome? Which effect does a novel therapy have on patients with depressive symptoms?</li>
<li>To investigates this hypothesis, a small set of relevant variables is chosen, which might be controlled for confounders.
Adequate data are collected.
Variable selection may incorporate controlling for confounders.</li>
<li>The strength of the associations between the selected variables and the outcome is assessed with regression models and statistical methods.</li>
<li>Based on the results, inferential statistics are computed and conclusions are drawn which may foster the implementation of novel preventive measures or the application of suited treatment forms to high-risk patients.</li>
</ol>
<p>Primary medical research can be classified into basic, clinical and epidemiological studies.</p>
<div id="basic-research" class="section level2" number="3.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Basic research</h2>
<p>Basic medical research (or experimental research) aims to improve understanding of cellular, molecular and physiological mechanisms of the human health and diseases by conducting cellular and molecular investigations, animal experiments, studies on drug and material properties in strictly controlled laboratory environments <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-Roehrig:Arztebl2009" role="doc-biblioref">1</a>]</span>.
To investigate (causal) effects of one or more variables of interest on the outcome, all other variables are usually kept constant and only those variables of interest are varied.
The carefully standardized experimental conditions of basic medical studies ensure a high internal validity, but these conditions often cannot be easily transferred to clinical practice without a loss of generalizability of the results.</p>
<p>!!! Basic research also includes the development and improvement of analytical (e.g., analytical determination of enzymes, markers, genes) and imaging measurement procedures (e.g., computer tomography, magnetic resonance tomography) as well as gene sequencing (e.g., the relationship between eye color and a specific gene sequence), and the development of biometric procedures such as statistical test procedures, modeling and statistical evaluation strategies.</p>
<p>A brief overview of important medical study types is given (see also <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-Roehrig:Arztebl2009" role="doc-biblioref">1</a>], [<a href="#ref-thiese2014observational" role="doc-biblioref">2</a>]</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="clinical-studies" class="section level2" number="3.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Clinical studies</h2>
<p>Clinical studies are generally classified into <em>interventional</em> (also: <em>experimental</em>) studies and <em>non-interventional</em> (also: <em>observational</em>) studies.</p>
<p>The general goal of an interventional study is to compare different treatments within a patient population whose members differ as little as possible, except for the treatment branch.
A common example is a pharmaceutical study which aims to validate the efficacy and harmlessness of a drug by investigating or establishing main and adverse effects, resorption, metabolization and excretion of the drug.
Selection bias can be avoided by appropriate measures, in particular by randomly assigning patients to the groups.</p>
<p>The treatment can be a drug, a surgical procedure or the therapeutic use of a medical product (e.g. stent), but also physiotherapy, acupuncture, psychosocial intervention, rehabilitation, training or diet.</p>
<p>A <em>randomized controlled trial</em> (RCT) is considered as study design “gold-standard” as it minimizes selection bias a. by randomly allocating patients to treatment and control group, and b.by ensuring equal distribution of known and unknown influencing variables (confounders), such as risk factors, comorbidities and genetic variabilities.
Thus, RCTs are suitable for obtaining an unambiguous answer to a clear question and proving causality.</p>
<p>In contrast, non-interventional clinical studies are patient-related observational studies in which patients receive an individually defined therapy (or all patients receive the exact same therapy).
Data analysis often takes place retrospectively.
Observational studies are often used to generate hypotheses.
- example: study that investigates the regular use of drugs in therapies
the treatment, including diagnosis and monitoring, does not follow a pre-defined trial protocol, but only medical practice</p>
<div id="prospective" class="section level4" number="3.2.0.1">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.2.0.1</span> prospective</h4>
<p>Prospective studies can be recognized by the chronological sequence of hypothesis generation and data collection.
First, the hypotheses to be tested are determined, for example with respect to a new treatment procedure.
Then, data are collected specifically for hypothesis testing.
By formulating testable hypotheses first, it can be ensured that the research questions can actually be answered with the measured data.
<!--- verification/testing of a hypothesis (e.g. efficacy of a novel treatment procedure)
- determine which specific hypothesis should be tested and then collect the data accordingly
- data was collected specifically for this study
- ensure that research questions can be answered with the given data--></p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Epidemiological studies</h2>
<p>TODO: Siehe Buch</p>
<p>Epidemiological studies are usually interested in the distribution and temporal change of the frequency of diseases and their causes in the general population or in sub-populations.
Analogous to clinical studies, epidemiology also distinguishes between experimental and observational studies. ???</p>
<p>A <em>cross-sectional</em> study (or prevalence study) is conducted only once whereas in a <em>longitudinal</em> study, the same study is carried out at several points in time and the results of the individual <em>waves</em> of investigation are compared.
Longitudinal studies are further categorized into <em>trend</em> and <em>panel</em> design.
In a <em>trend</em> study, each wave can involve a different participant sample, i.e., an individual participant is not followed over time.
In contrast, a <em>panel</em> study investigates the same population at multiple points in time which allows to also measure <em>intra-individual</em> temporal changes.</p>

<p>After the reunification of Germany, it was found that life expectancy was considerably lower in the east than in the west <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-volzke2015prevalence" role="doc-biblioref">3</a>]</span>.
Furthermore, there were regional differences within the former East Germany, with the lowest life expectancy in the northeast <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-volzke2015prevalence" role="doc-biblioref">3</a>], [<a href="#ref-wiesner2004life" role="doc-biblioref">4</a>]</span>.
To investigate the causal relationship between the high mortality in the northeastern German population and its risk factors, the research center for community medicine established the  (SHIP) <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-Voelzke:SHIP11" role="doc-biblioref">5</a>]</span>, a longitudinal epidemiological study of two independent cohorts in the northeast of Germany.
SHIP attempts to describe a wide spectrum of health-related conditions rather than focusing on a specific target disease <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-Voelzke:SHIP11" role="doc-biblioref">5</a>]</span>.
In particular, major study goals comprise investigations regarding prevalence of common diseases and their risk factors, correlation and interaction between risk factors and diseases, progression from subclinical to manifest diseases, identification of subgroups with elevated health risk, prediction of incidental diseases, as well as utilization and costs of medical devices. TODO: shorten</p>
<p>Cohort inclusion criteria were age from 20 to 79 years, main residency in the study region and German nationality.
Participants of SHIP underwent an extensive, recurring (ca. every 5-6 years) examination program that encompasses personal interviews, body measurements, exercise electrocardiogram, laboratory analysis, ultrasound examinations and full body magnetic resonance tomography (MRT).
Figure @ref:(fig:ship-sankey-plot) illustrates participant response and age distribution of show-ups across study waves.
Baseline examinations for the first cohort were performed between 1997 and 2001 (SHIP-0, N=4308).
Followup examinations were done in 2002-2006 (SHIP-1, n=3300), 2008-2012 (SHIP-2, n=2333), 2014-2016 (SHIP-3, n=1718) and since 2019 (SHIP-4).
Baseline information for a second, independent cohort (SHIP-Trend-0, N=4420) was collected between 2008 and 2012 and a followup was conducted between 2016 and 2019.
Major strengths of SHIP are a high level of quality assurance, standardized examination protocols, and a high cohort representativeness.</p>

For example, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was only conducted since SHIP-2; liver ultrasound was carried out in SHIP-0 and SHIP-2, but not in SHIP-1; dermatological examinations were conducted in SHIP-1 and SHIP-2, but not in SHIP-0.</p>
<p>In our analyses, we focus on the disorder hepatic steatosis, also known as fatty liver, a condition which is characterized by a high accumulation of fat in the liver and present in ca. 30% of all adults <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-Voelzke:SHIP11" role="doc-biblioref">5</a>], [<a href="#ref-volzke2005hepatic" role="doc-biblioref">6</a>]</span>.
Risk factors include alcohol abuse, obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-antunes2019fatty" role="doc-biblioref">7</a>]</span>.
A liver biopsy is considered as diagnosis gold standard <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-antunes2019fatty" role="doc-biblioref">7</a>]</span>, but is associated with moderate risk for the patient.
Non-invasive diagnosis forms include MRT, CT and ultrasound.
Since hepatic steatosis is mostly asymptomatic, it often remains undiscovered which may develop into a more serious disease, such as steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, liver cell carcinoma or liver failure.</p>
<p>Our target variable is derived from the participant’s liver fat percentage computed from MRI scans.
More specifically, participant with a liver fat concentration of 10% or less are mapped to class A (“negative” class, i.e., absence of the disorder); values greater than 10% and lower than 25% are mapped to class B (increased liver fat / fatty liver tendency); values greater than 25% are mapped to class C (high liver fat).
We consider classes B and C as “positive”.
Although the cut-off value of 10% is higher than the value of 5% suggested by <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-KuehnEtAl:2011" role="doc-biblioref">8</a>]</span> for separation between subjects with and without hepatic steatosis.
However, the primary interest from the medical perspective was the identification of important variables for individuals that are likely to be ill. 
The selection of a high cut-off value exacerbated class imbalance and made the data analysis more challenging.</p>
<!--#### Findings so far
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4390827/#R2
Consumption of both alcohol and tobacco is decreasing in the population of northeastern Germany.

Physical inactivity is decreasing in older adults, but increasing in younger women.

The prevalence of both obesity and diabetes mellitus is rising sharply.

Preventive measures should more specifically target obesity-->

Currently data for the three study waves SHIP-0, SHIP-
1 and SHIP-2 exists. The baseline examinations of SHIP-
0 (n=4308) were performed between 1997 and 2001, and
the followups SHIP-1 (n=3300) between 2002-2006 and
SHIP-2 (n=2333) between 2008-2012. We focus on the
liver disorder hepatic steatosis, also known as fatty liver,
and a subset of 886 study participants (hereafter denoted
as SHIP-886) which participated in all three waves. The
class variable is derived from a liver-fat measurement of
a MRT examination that was only conducted during SHIP-
2 [2], [3]: participants with a liver fat concentration value
of less than 25% are assigned the negative class, i.e. they
are treated as not suffering from hepatic steatosis, whereas
participants with greater values are assigned the positive
class. Of the 886 study participants, XXX belong to the
positive class and XXX to the negative class. Additionally
to the inspection of all 886 study participants, we consider
the female participants (Subsetf ) and male participants
(Subsetm) separately, similarly to [2] and [3]. Subsetf
contains XXX individuals of which XX% are positive and-->
<!--The variables include sociodemographics, medical tests, ultrasound and whole-body MRT %, as well as variables from interviews on lifestyle, ailments etc
\cite{NiemannEtal:ESWA14,HielscherEtAl:CBMS14}.
%\textcolor[rgb]{0,0,1}{ The first moment, SHIP-0, contains n=4308 participants (recordings from 1997 to 2001); the recordings of the second moment SHIP-1 (n=3300 of the 4308 participants) were made in 2002-2006. MRT was recorded only in the third moment SHIP-2 (2008-2012, n= 2333).}
We consider 462 variables, where measurements of the same variable at different moments are treated as distinct variables. As in \cite{HielscherEtAl:IDA14}, we derive the binary target variable from a continuous variable that measures fat accumulation in the liver: an accumulation of more than 10\% corresponds to the positive class.
%take the variable mrt\_liverfat\_s2 (fat concentration in the liver) as basis to derive a binary classification variable:
%The positive class corresponds to a fat concentration of more than 10\%.
We use a random sample of 888 SHIP participants, 462 female ones (positive: 19\%) and 426 male ones (positive: 35\%).
%According to \cite{NiemannEtal:ESWA14}, learning on the original continuous variable lead to an inferior model, so we do not consider regression hereafter and stick to the transformed binary variable. 
%We consider 462 features, whereby the same feature at different moments (e.g. of the Body Mass Index) is counted as distinct features. 

%The dataset studied in \cite{NiemannEtal:ESWA14,HielscherEtAl:CBMS14,HielscherEtAl:IDA14} consists of 578 participants; we consider 310 more participants, and denote this superset as \subcohort. Following their findings on the differences between female and male participants with respect to the outcome, we also split the dataset into \partitionF (462 female participants, 19\% positive) and \partitionM (426 male participants, 35\% positive) and learn on each partition. 

%The class distribution is the same as for the 578 participants they studied, and so are the distribution of female and male participants and the prevalence of each class for each gender; the identical distributions are a natural consequence of the fact that the additional participants were randomly chosen. 

%\color{blue}SHIP participants undergo an examination program consisting of interviews, exercise tests, laboratory analysis, ultrasound examinations and whole-body magnetic resonance tomography (MRT). \color{black} For the first SHIP cohort, three examination waves, hereinafter denoted as "`moments"', exist: SHIP-0 (1997-2001, n= 4308), SHIP-1 (2002-2006, n= 3300) and SHIP-2 (2008-2012, n= 2333). \color{black}The continuous target variable containing the liver fat concentration (mrt\_liverfat\_s2) is only available in SHIP-2 and for a subset of 888 participants which we denote as \subcohort. Results of examinations which were repeatedly executed across the three study moments 0,1,2 are recorded in \subcohort as different features, e.g. som\_bmi\_s0, som\_bmi\_s1, som\_bmi\_s2 for the somatographic Body Mass Index, accumulating to 462 features. Prediction of the original continuous target feature with regression methods led to lackluster results as shown in \cite{NiemannEtal:ESWA14}. We therefore use the discretized target feature of \cite{HielscherEtAl:CBMS14} and \cite{NiemannEtal:ESWA14} to formulate a binary classification problem.
%%\color{blue}In \cite{NiemannEtal:ESWA14}, the use of the original target variable with regression led to poor results, we therefore discretize the target variable into a positive and negative class, with cut-off value choices as shown in \cite{HielscherEtAl:CBMS14} and \cite{NiemannEtal:ESWA14} to formulate a classification problem. 
%\color{black}Because of differing class distributions and number of features, we consider, as in the aforementioned works, the partition of female participants (\partitionF) and male participants (\partitionM) separately. After splitting the dataset \partitionF contains 462 individuals with a relative negative-class frequency of 0.81 and \partitionM contains 426 individuals with a relative negative-class frequency of 0.65.

%%SHIP is a population-based project \cite{Voelzke:SHIP2011_abbr}: persons are chosen who reside in Pomerania (Northeast Germany) and are between 20 and 79 years old. SHIP participants undergo an examination program consisting of interviews, exercise tests, laboratory analysis, ultrasound examinations and whole-body magnetic resonance tomography (MRT). Three examination "`moments"' of the first SHIP cohort exist, SHIP-0 (1997-2001, n= 4308), SHIP-1 (2002-2006, n= 3300) and SHIP-2 (2008-2012, n= 2333). We have the SHIP-2 liver fat concentration only for 578 participants (mrt\_liverfat\_s2). The values of assessments at the three moments 0,1,2 are recorded in \subcohort as different features, e.g. som\_bmi\_s0, som\_bmi\_s1, som\_bmi\_s2 for the somatographic Body Mass Index (see also Figure 2, left upper part). In \cite{NiemannEtAl:ESWA14}, the use of the original target variable with regression led to poor results, we therefore discretize the continuous target variable into a positive and negative class, with cut-off value choices as shown in \cite{HielscherEtAl:cbms14} and \cite{NiemannEtAl:ESWA14} to formulate a classification problem.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.7</span> The Diabetic Foot Clinical Trial (DF)</h2>
<!--**DFSS**. While SHIP investigates associations between risk factors of common diseases and health-related conditions in general, the ``Diabetic Foot Syndrome'' study&nbsp;[@Niemann:PONE2016;@Niemann:EBio19] is a case-control study specifically investigating differences between diabetes patients diagnosed with severe polyneuropathy and healthy controls. 
In a pre-specified sequence of actions alternating between two postures, standing and sitting, custom-made sensor-bearing insoles placed in a closed shoe measured changes of a subject's plantar pressures and temperatures with high frequency over time. 
These measurements allowed for the analysis of pathophysiological and sensation-related differences between the two groups. -->
<p> is an umbrella term of foot-related problems in diabetes patients.
Up to one out of four diabetes patients develop a foot ulcer during their lifetime <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-RN1" role="doc-biblioref">9</a>]</span> with many of them facing amputations in the next four years <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-RN2" role="doc-biblioref">10</a>]</span>.
More than 85% of foot amputations relate to foot ulcers <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-RN3" role="doc-biblioref">11</a>], [<a href="#ref-RN4" role="doc-biblioref">12</a>]</span>.
The rate of foot amputations among diabetic patients has been estimated to be 17–40 times higher than in the general population <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-fard2007assessment" role="doc-biblioref">13</a>]</span>.
DFS patients are predisposed to a peripheral sensoric neuropathy, which, for example, have the consequence that patients are unaware of the temperature of their feet, or the pressure they apply on them.
Affected individuals may even injure themselves without noticing.
Excessive plantar pressure loads may aggravate tissue destruction, increasing the lifetime risk of a foot ulceration <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-SinghEtAl:PreventingFootUlcers2005" role="doc-biblioref">14</a>]</span>.
However, the understanding of the pathomechanisms underlying tissue destruction without trauma is limited.</p>
<!--therapeutic footwear-->
<p>At the Medical Faculty of the Otto von Guericke University Magdeburg, an experimental study with 31 healthy volunteers and 30 diabetes patients diagnosed with severe polyneuropathy was conducted to quantify pressure- and posture-dependent changes of plantar temperatures as a surrogate of tissue perfusion.
For this purpose, plantar pressure and temperature changes in the feet were recorded during extended phases of standing.
Custom-made shoe insoles <!--!!! cite Grützner-->
equipped with eight temperature sensors and eight pressure sensors at preselected positions were used for data acquisition (@ref(fig:02_df-infrared-sole-sensor-positions-plot) (a)).
The insoles were positioned into closed protective shoes specifically developed for diabetes patients.
Within such shoes the temperature increases over time due to exchange with the body temperature of the user and is also affected by the environmental temperature.
To closely monitor the in-shoe temperature changes one sensor was placed at the bottom of the insole without contact to the feet, which was denoted “ambient temperature sensor”.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>The data acquisition started immediately after putting on the shoes.
The participants were asked to follow a predefined sequence of actions, that are alternating postures of standing (stance phase) and seating (pause).
The sessions consisted of six stance episodes, lasting 5, 10, 20, 5, 10 and 20 minutes each, separated by seating episodes lasting 5 min each.
<!--In between, the participants were asked to take up a sitting position for 5 minutes, and to release the pressure off their feet. -->
The participants were instructed to apply pressure equally on both feet while standing.
Participants did not receive immediate feedback of the actual pressure application during the sessions, however study nurses verbally encouraged to keep the pressure without release while standing.
In the seated position the participants were instructed to release pressure for 5 minutes, while still keeping contact to the insole.
The participants were explicitly asked to adhere to these instructions, e.g. they should not temporarily release pressure during a stance episode.
The study protocol furthermore encompassed that the measurements were performed twice, once at room temperature of ca 22°C and once outdoors with an ambient temperature of ca. 16°C.
The two measurements were performed on two independent days.</p>
<p>The termographic images in Figure @ref(fig:02_df-infrared-sole-sensor-positions-plot) (b) exemplarily visualize changes of plantar temperature, for a healthy volunteer in a seated position, before pressure application (1), after placement of a 20 kg weight on the front of the upper thighs (2-6), and after removal of the additional weight (7-8).
During pressure load, a gradual temporal temperature decrease was detected predominantly in the forefoot.
After pressure release, a rapid temperature rise within 1 min was observed.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.9</span> The Tinnitus Patients Observational Therapy Study Dataset (CHA)</h2>
<p>Tinnitus is the perception of a phantom sound in absence of an external sound source.
It is a complex multi-factorially caused and maintained phenomenon, and estimated to affect between 10% and 15% of the adult population <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-Baguley:Tinnitus2013" role="doc-biblioref">15</a>]</span>.
The associated annual economic burden amounts to US$19.4 billion in the
United States <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-Bhatt:TinnitusAnxietyDepression2017" role="doc-biblioref">16</a>]</span> and €6.8 billion in the Netherlands alone <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-Maes:TinnitusCosts2013" role="doc-biblioref">17</a>]</span>.
Clinical assessment of tinnitus is challenging due patient heterogeneities with respect to perception of tinnitus (laterality, pitch, sound characteristics, frequency, permanence, chronicity), risk factors (including hearing loss, temporomandibular joint disorder, aging), comorbidities (including hyperacusis, depression, sleep disorders), perceived distress, and treatment response <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-Cederroth2019" role="doc-biblioref">18</a>]</span>.
These differences make the identification of a suitable and effective form of treatment difficult.
Currently, there does not exist a therapy gold standard: sound therapy (masking), informational counseling (minimal contact education), cognitive behavioral therapy and tinnitus retraining were found to be effective for some patients, but there is also evidence that not all patients benefit equally from these treatment forms <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-Hobson:SoundTherapy2012" role="doc-biblioref">19</a>]–[<a href="#ref-Phillips:TRT2010" role="doc-biblioref">23</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Due to the heterogeneous nature of the tinnitus symptom as well as the unclear
evidence-base as to its treatment and management, the identification of patient subgroups is vital to stratify individual pathophysiology and treatment pathways <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-Langguth:LCA2017" role="doc-biblioref">24</a>]–[<a href="#ref-Landgrebe:TRI2010" role="doc-biblioref">26</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>The “tinnitus patients observational therapy study dataset” (<em>CHA</em>) comprises self-report data from 4,103 tinnitus patients who had been treated at the Tinnitus Center of Charité University Medicine Berlin between January 2011 and October 2015.
All patients were 18 years of age or older and had been suffering from tinnitus for at least 3 months.
Exclusion criteria were presence of acute psychotic illness or addiction disorder, deafness and insufficient knowledge of the German language.
Treatment comprised a multimodal 7-day program that included intensive and daily informational counseling, detailed ear-nose-throat as well as psychological diagnostics, cognitive behavior therapy interventions, hearing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation and physiotherapy.
At baseline (<em>T0</em>; before therapy commencement) and after treatment (<em>T1</em>), patients were asked to complete multiple self-report questionnaires assessing socio-demographics, tinnitus-related distress, tinnitus severity, localization, quality, frequency and loudness, as well as physical and mental health status, including levels of depression and perceived stress.
Table @ref(tab:cha_questionnaires) provides an overview of all questionnaires used in the analysis.
Most questionnaires contain multiple-choice items with answers on a Likert scale. For example, the TQ contains 52 statements, such as “I am unable to enjoy listening to music because of the noises.”, and respondents can give 3 possible answers: “not true” (encoded as 0), “partly true” (1) and “true” (2).
Some questionnaires also comprise aggregated variables, called “subscales” and “total scores”.
For example, the TQ total score (TQ_distress) is calculated as sum of 40 item values, where 2 items are used twice <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-GoebelHiller:TF1998" role="doc-biblioref">27</a>]</span>, yielding a value range from 0 to 84, where higher values represent higher tinnitus-related distress.
The cutoff value 46 <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-GoebelHiller:TF1998" role="doc-biblioref">27</a>]</span> is used to distinguish between <em>compensated</em> (0-46) and <em>decompensated</em> (47-84) tinnitus.
Further, for each questionnaire, the average time to answer an item was recorded. Figure @ref:(fig:cha-patient-demographics-plot) provides a graphical illustration of demographics for 3,803 (92.7%) patients with complete data for the SOZ questionnaire and TQ score.</p>

<!-- Tinnitus-related distress was measured by the TQ total score (TQ\_distress).  -->
<!-- Depression severity was obtained using the ADSL depression score (ADSL\_depression). -->
<!-- For TQ\_distress and ADSL\_depression, treatment effects were calculated as differences between T0 and T1 (denoted as teffect\_TQ\_distress and teffect\_ADSL\_depression).  -->
<!-- Hence, a negative (positive) score indicates that the patient exhibited a lower (higher) score in T1 (after therapy) than in T0 (before therapy).  -->
<!-- Patients with incomplete data were excluded, resulting in a total number of \changemarker{1,628} patients, with  -->
<!-- clinical data summarized in Figure~\ref{fig:patient_characteristics}.  -->
<!-- These \changemarker{828} female (50.9\%) and 800 male (49.1\%) patients were between \changemarker{18} and 83 years of age, with an average of 50.2 years (SD = 12.0).  -->
<!-- % There was no significant difference in age between genders (two-sided $t$-test; $\alpha=0.05$).  -->
<!-- Approximately a third (33\%) had been suffering from tinnitus (bilateral: 41\%, unilateral left: 32\%, unilateral right: 26\%) for more than 5 years. -->
<!-- Tinnitus refers to the perception of sound, such as ringing, whistling, hissing or rustling) in absence of an external sound stimulus~\citep{Eggermont:Neuroscience2004} and is experienced by 12-30 percent of the general population~\citep{McCormack:TinnitusPrevalence2016}.  -->
<!-- A subset of 1-2\% of all people report considerable impairment with respect to quality of life associated with the tinnitus percept \citep{Langguth:Lancet2013}.  -->
<!-- Due to its clinical heterogeneity in cause, perception and accompanying symptoms~\citep{Langguth:Lancet2013}, a treatment gold standard that is effective for every patient has not been established yet, despite scientifically proven efficacy of cognitive behavioral approaches in reducing tinnitus-related distress for some patients~\citep{Andersson:Psychological2002, Andersson:TinnitusTreatment1999, Cima:CBT2014, Cima:CBT2012}.  -->
