<!-- # Prerequisites {-} -->

<!-- This is a _sample_ book written in **Markdown**. You can use anything that Pandoc's Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$. -->

<!-- The **bookdown** package can be installed from CRAN or Github: -->

```{r prereq-install-bookdown, echo = FALSE, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("bookdown")
install.packages("citr")
# or the development version
# devtools::install_github("rstudio/bookdown")
```

<!-- Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading `#`. -->

<!-- To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): <https://yihui.name/tinytex/>. -->

```{r prereq-write-bib, include=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
