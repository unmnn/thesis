----

## Fundamental terms and study types

Typical goals of medical research include identifying long-term determinants and protective factors for an outcome of interest, discovering sub-populations with increased disease prevalence, studying intervention effects by generating statistical (causal) models that explain cause-effect relationships. 

<!--- discover and describe the statistical (causal) relationship between certain factors (genetic abnormalities, pollutants, lifestyle, drugs or medical treatment) on the one hand and certain subsequent health changes, such as illness, improvement or recovery on the other (wiki)-->

Traditional data analysis pipelines are usually structured as follows: 

(1) A medical scholar formulates a hypothesis based on observations in clinical practice or current research. Examples: how does a risk factor like alcohol abuse affects the prevalence of a certain outcome? Which effect does a novel therapy have on patients with depressive symptoms?
(2) To investigates this hypothesis, a small set of relevant variables is chosen, which might be controlled for confounders. 
Adequate data are collected. 
Variable selection may incorporate controlling for confounders.
(3) The strength of the associations between the selected variables and the outcome is assessed with regression models and statistical methods.
(4) Based on the results, inferential statistics are computed and conclusions are drawn which may foster the implementation of novel preventive measures or the application of suited treatment forms to high-risk patients.

Primary medical research can be classified into basic, clinical and epidemiological studies.

## Basic research

Basic medical research (or experimental research) aims to improve understanding of cellular, molecular and physiological mechanisms of the human health and diseases by conducting cellular and molecular investigations, animal experiments, studies on drug and material properties in strictly controlled laboratory environments [@Roehrig:Arztebl2009]. 
To investigate (causal) effects of one or more variables of interest on the outcome, all other variables are usually kept constant and only those variables of interest are varied. 
The carefully standardized experimental conditions of basic medical studies ensure a high internal validity, but these conditions often cannot be easily transferred to clinical practice without a loss of generalizability of the results. 

!!! Basic research also includes the development and improvement of analytical (e.g., analytical determination of enzymes, markers, genes) and imaging measurement procedures (e.g., computer tomography, magnetic resonance tomography) as well as gene sequencing (e.g., the relationship between eye color and a specific gene sequence), and the development of biometric procedures such as statistical test procedures, modeling and statistical evaluation strategies.

A brief overview of important medical study types is given (see also [@thiese2014observational; @Roehrig:Arztebl2009]. 

## Clinical studies

Clinical studies are generally classified into _interventional_ (also: _experimental_) studies and _non-interventional_ (also: _observational_) studies. 

The general goal of an interventional study is to compare different treatments within a patient population whose members differ as little as possible, except for the treatment branch. 
A common example is a pharmaceutical study which aims to validate the efficacy and harmlessness of a drug by investigating or establishing main and adverse effects, resorption, metabolization and excretion of the drug. 
Selection bias can be avoided by appropriate measures, in particular by randomly assigning patients to the groups. 

The treatment can be a drug, a surgical procedure or the therapeutic use of a medical product (e.g. stent), but also physiotherapy, acupuncture, psychosocial intervention, rehabilitation, training or diet. 

A _randomized controlled trial_ (RCT) is considered as study design "gold-standard" as it minimizes selection bias a. by randomly allocating patients to treatment and control group, and b.by ensuring equal distribution of known and unknown influencing variables (confounders), such as risk factors, comorbidities and genetic variabilities. 
Thus, RCTs are suitable for obtaining an unambiguous answer to a clear question and proving causality. 

In contrast, non-interventional clinical studies are patient-related observational studies in which patients receive an individually defined therapy (or all patients receive the exact same therapy). 
Data analysis often takes place retrospectively. 
Observational studies are often used to generate hypotheses.
- example: study that investigates the regular use of drugs in therapies
the treatment, including diagnosis and monitoring, does not follow a pre-defined trial protocol, but only medical practice


#### prospective

Prospective studies can be recognized by the chronological sequence of hypothesis generation and data collection. 
First, the hypotheses to be tested are determined, for example with respect to a new treatment procedure. 
Then, data are collected specifically for hypothesis testing. 
By formulating testable hypotheses first, it can be ensured that the research questions can actually be answered with the measured data. 
<!--- verification/testing of a hypothesis (e.g. efficacy of a novel treatment procedure)
- determine which specific hypothesis should be tested and then collect the data accordingly
- data was collected specifically for this study
- ensure that research questions can be answered with the given data-->

#### retrospective

data collection has already taken place before the start of the study

examples:

digitalized medical databases 


## Epidemiological studies

TODO: Siehe Buch

Epidemiological studies are usually interested in the distribution and temporal change of the frequency of diseases and their causes in the general population or in sub-populations. 
Analogous to clinical studies, epidemiology also distinguishes between experimental and observational studies. ???

A _cross-sectional_ study (or prevalence study) is conducted only once whereas in a _longitudinal_ study, the same study is carried out at several points in time and the results of the individual _waves_ of investigation are compared.
Longitudinal studies are further categorized into _trend_ and _panel_ design. 
In a _trend_ study, each wave can involve a different participant sample, i.e., an individual participant is not followed over time.
In contrast, a _panel_ study investigates the same population at multiple points in time which allows to also measure _intra-individual_ temporal changes. 



#### controlled vs. uncontrolled


- epidemiological vs clinical vs experimental study
- what is a cohort
- samples (clinical samples, medical research samples) -> validity?



## Challenges

- heterogeneity (numeric, categorical)
- pre-processing of raw image data (non-tabular data)
- different requirements for different studies

## Medical Applications

### The Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) {#ship}

<!-- **Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP)**. The "Study of Health in Pomerania" (SHIP) [@Voelzke:SHIP11] encompasses two independent cohorts, SHIP-CORE and SHIP-TREND, consisting of participants aged from 20 to 79 years with main residency in the study region.  -->
<!-- Baseline examinations for SHIP-CORE were performed between 1997 and 2001 (SHIP-0, n=4308). Three follow-up examinations were conducted in intervals of 5 years, continuously adding new variables including MRI scans beginning from the second follow-up (SHIP-2).  -->
<!-- Baseline information for the SHIP-TREND (TREND-0, n=4420) was collected in 2008-2012.  -->
<!-- In both cohorts, a broad range of participant information was gathered, including socio-demographics, lifestyle and consumption behavior, medication intake, anthropometric values, blood and urine laboratory values, whole-body magnet resonance imaging, and others. -->

After the reunification of Germany, it was found that life expectancy was considerably lower in the east than in the west [@volzke2015prevalence]. 
Furthermore, there were regional differences within the former East Germany, with the lowest life expectancy in the northeast [@volzke2015prevalence; @wiesner2004life]. 
To investigate the causal relationship between the high mortality in the northeastern German population and its risk factors, the research center for community medicine established the _Study of Health in Pomerania_ (SHIP) [@Voelzke:SHIP11], a longitudinal epidemiological study of two independent cohorts in the northeast of Germany. 
SHIP attempts to describe a wide spectrum of health-related conditions rather than focusing on a specific target disease [@Voelzke:SHIP11]. 
In particular, major study goals comprise investigations regarding prevalence of common diseases and their risk factors, correlation and interaction between risk factors and diseases, progression from subclinical to manifest diseases, identification of subgroups with elevated health risk, prediction of incidental diseases, as well as utilization and costs of medical devices. TODO: shorten

Cohort inclusion criteria were age from 20 to 79 years, main residency in the study region and German nationality. 
Participants of SHIP underwent an extensive, recurring (ca. every 5-6 years) examination program that encompasses personal interviews, body measurements, exercise electrocardiogram, laboratory analysis, ultrasound examinations and full body magnetic resonance tomography (MRT).
Figure \@ref:(fig:ship-sankey-plot) illustrates participant response and age distribution of show-ups across study waves. 
Baseline examinations for the first cohort were performed between 1997 and 2001 (SHIP-0, N=4308). 
Followup examinations were done in 2002-2006 (SHIP-1, n=3300), 2008-2012 (SHIP-2, n=2333), 2014-2016 (SHIP-3, n=1718) and since 2019 (SHIP-4). 
Baseline information for a second, independent cohort (SHIP-Trend-0, N=4420) was collected between 2008 and 2012 and a followup was conducted between 2016 and 2019. 
Major strengths of SHIP are a high level of quality assurance, standardized examination protocols, and a high cohort representativeness.

(ref:02-ship-sankey) **Participation response and age distribution of show-ups across study waves in SHIP.** Average population age is shown as black vertical line in the histograms.

knitr::include_graphics("figures/02-ship-sankey.png")
```

The examination program changed across waves. 
For example, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was only conducted since SHIP-2; liver ultrasound was carried out in SHIP-0 and SHIP-2, but not in SHIP-1; dermatological examinations were conducted in SHIP-1 and SHIP-2, but not in SHIP-0. 

In our analyses, we focus on the disorder hepatic steatosis, also known as fatty liver, a condition which is characterized by a high accumulation of fat in the liver and present in ca. 30% of all adults [@Voelzke:SHIP11; @volzke2005hepatic]. 
Risk factors include alcohol abuse, obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia [@antunes2019fatty]. 
A liver biopsy is considered as diagnosis gold standard [@antunes2019fatty], but is associated with moderate risk for the patient. 
Non-invasive diagnosis forms include MRT, CT and ultrasound.
Since hepatic steatosis is mostly asymptomatic, it often remains undiscovered which may develop into a more serious disease, such as steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, liver cell carcinoma or liver failure.

<!-- Our target variable is derived from the participant's liver fat percentage computed from MRI scans.  -->
<!-- More specifically, participant with a liver fat concentration of 10% or less are mapped to class A ("negative" class, i.e., absence of the disorder); values greater than 10% and lower than 25% are mapped to class B (increased liver fat / fatty liver tendency); values greater than 25% are mapped to class C (high liver fat).  -->
<!-- We consider classes B and C as "positive".  -->
<!-- Although the cut-off value of 10% is higher than the value of 5% suggested by [@KuehnEtAl:2011] for separation between subjects with and without hepatic steatosis.  -->
<!-- However, the primary interest from the medical perspective was the identification of important variables for individuals that are likely to be ill.  -->
<!-- The selection of a high cut-off value exacerbated class imbalance and made the data analysis more challenging.  -->



<!--#### Findings so far
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4390827/#R2
Consumption of both alcohol and tobacco is decreasing in the population of northeastern Germany.

Physical inactivity is decreasing in older adults, but increasing in younger women.

The prevalence of both obesity and diabetes mellitus is rising sharply.

Preventive measures should more specifically target obesity-->


<!--
Currently data for the three study waves SHIP-0, SHIP-
1 and SHIP-2 exists. The baseline examinations of SHIP-
0 (n=4308) were performed between 1997 and 2001, and
the followups SHIP-1 (n=3300) between 2002-2006 and
SHIP-2 (n=2333) between 2008-2012. We focus on the
liver disorder hepatic steatosis, also known as fatty liver,
and a subset of 886 study participants (hereafter denoted
as SHIP-886) which participated in all three waves. The
class variable is derived from a liver-fat measurement of
a MRT examination that was only conducted during SHIP-
2 [2], [3]: participants with a liver fat concentration value
of less than 25% are assigned the negative class, i.e. they
are treated as not suffering from hepatic steatosis, whereas
participants with greater values are assigned the positive
class. Of the 886 study participants, XXX belong to the
positive class and XXX to the negative class. Additionally
to the inspection of all 886 study participants, we consider
the female participants (Subsetf ) and male participants
(Subsetm) separately, similarly to [2] and [3]. Subsetf
contains XXX individuals of which XX% are positive and-->

<!--The variables include sociodemographics, medical tests, ultrasound and whole-body MRT %, as well as variables from interviews on lifestyle, ailments etc
\cite{NiemannEtal:ESWA14,HielscherEtAl:CBMS14}.
%\textcolor[rgb]{0,0,1}{ The first moment, SHIP-0, contains n=4308 participants (recordings from 1997 to 2001); the recordings of the second moment SHIP-1 (n=3300 of the 4308 participants) were made in 2002-2006. MRT was recorded only in the third moment SHIP-2 (2008-2012, n= 2333).}
We consider 462 variables, where measurements of the same variable at different moments are treated as distinct variables. As in \cite{HielscherEtAl:IDA14}, we derive the binary target variable from a continuous variable that measures fat accumulation in the liver: an accumulation of more than 10\% corresponds to the positive class.
%take the variable mrt\_liverfat\_s2 (fat concentration in the liver) as basis to derive a binary classification variable:
%The positive class corresponds to a fat concentration of more than 10\%.
We use a random sample of 888 SHIP participants, 462 female ones (positive: 19\%) and 426 male ones (positive: 35\%).
%According to \cite{NiemannEtal:ESWA14}, learning on the original continuous variable lead to an inferior model, so we do not consider regression hereafter and stick to the transformed binary variable. 
%We consider 462 features, whereby the same feature at different moments (e.g. of the Body Mass Index) is counted as distinct features. 

%The dataset studied in \cite{NiemannEtal:ESWA14,HielscherEtAl:CBMS14,HielscherEtAl:IDA14} consists of 578 participants; we consider 310 more participants, and denote this superset as \subcohort. Following their findings on the differences between female and male participants with respect to the outcome, we also split the dataset into \partitionF (462 female participants, 19\% positive) and \partitionM (426 male participants, 35\% positive) and learn on each partition. 

%The class distribution is the same as for the 578 participants they studied, and so are the distribution of female and male participants and the prevalence of each class for each gender; the identical distributions are a natural consequence of the fact that the additional participants were randomly chosen. 

%\color{blue}SHIP participants undergo an examination program consisting of interviews, exercise tests, laboratory analysis, ultrasound examinations and whole-body magnetic resonance tomography (MRT). \color{black} For the first SHIP cohort, three examination waves, hereinafter denoted as "`moments"', exist: SHIP-0 (1997-2001, n= 4308), SHIP-1 (2002-2006, n= 3300) and SHIP-2 (2008-2012, n= 2333). \color{black}The continuous target variable containing the liver fat concentration (mrt\_liverfat\_s2) is only available in SHIP-2 and for a subset of 888 participants which we denote as \subcohort. Results of examinations which were repeatedly executed across the three study moments 0,1,2 are recorded in \subcohort as different features, e.g. som\_bmi\_s0, som\_bmi\_s1, som\_bmi\_s2 for the somatographic Body Mass Index, accumulating to 462 features. Prediction of the original continuous target feature with regression methods led to lackluster results as shown in \cite{NiemannEtal:ESWA14}. We therefore use the discretized target feature of \cite{HielscherEtAl:CBMS14} and \cite{NiemannEtal:ESWA14} to formulate a binary classification problem.
%%\color{blue}In \cite{NiemannEtal:ESWA14}, the use of the original target variable with regression led to poor results, we therefore discretize the target variable into a positive and negative class, with cut-off value choices as shown in \cite{HielscherEtAl:CBMS14} and \cite{NiemannEtal:ESWA14} to formulate a classification problem. 
%\color{black}Because of differing class distributions and number of features, we consider, as in the aforementioned works, the partition of female participants (\partitionF) and male participants (\partitionM) separately. After splitting the dataset \partitionF contains 462 individuals with a relative negative-class frequency of 0.81 and \partitionM contains 426 individuals with a relative negative-class frequency of 0.65.

%%SHIP is a population-based project \cite{Voelzke:SHIP2011_abbr}: persons are chosen who reside in Pomerania (Northeast Germany) and are between 20 and 79 years old. SHIP participants undergo an examination program consisting of interviews, exercise tests, laboratory analysis, ultrasound examinations and whole-body magnetic resonance tomography (MRT). Three examination "`moments"' of the first SHIP cohort exist, SHIP-0 (1997-2001, n= 4308), SHIP-1 (2002-2006, n= 3300) and SHIP-2 (2008-2012, n= 2333). We have the SHIP-2 liver fat concentration only for 578 participants (mrt\_liverfat\_s2). The values of assessments at the three moments 0,1,2 are recorded in \subcohort as different features, e.g. som\_bmi\_s0, som\_bmi\_s1, som\_bmi\_s2 for the somatographic Body Mass Index (see also Figure 2, left upper part).

### The Diabetic Foot Clinical Trial (DF)

<!-- **The diabetic foot clinical study dataset (DFD)**. While SHIP investigates associations between risk factors of common diseases and health-related conditions in general, the "diabetic foot clinical study"&nbsp;[@Niemann:PONE2016;@Niemann:EBioMedicine2020]  -->
<!-- <!-- is a case-control study specifically investigating  --> -->
<!-- investigates differences between diabetes patients diagnosed with severe polyneuropathy and healthy controls. -->
<!-- In a pre-specified sequence of actions alternating between two postures, standing and sitting, custom-made sensor-bearing insoles placed in a closed shoe measured changes of a subject's plantar pressures and temperatures with high frequency over time.  -->
<!-- These measurements allowed for the analysis of pathophysiological and sensation-related differences between the two groups.  -->

_Diabetic foot syndrom_ is an umbrella term of foot-related problems in diabetes patients. 
Up to one out of four diabetes patients develop a foot ulcer during their lifetime [@RN1] with many of them facing amputations in the next four years [@RN2].
More than 85% of foot amputations relate to foot ulcers [@RN3; @RN4]. 
The rate of foot amputations among diabetic patients has been estimated to be 17–40 times higher than in the general population [@fard2007assessment]. 
DFS patients are predisposed to a peripheral sensoric neuropathy, which, for example, have the consequence that patients are unaware of the temperature of their feet, or the pressure they apply on them. 
Affected individuals may even injure themselves without noticing. 
Excessive plantar pressure loads may aggravate tissue destruction, increasing the lifetime risk of a foot ulceration [@SinghEtAl:PreventingFootUlcers2005]. 
However, the understanding of the pathomechanisms underlying tissue destruction without trauma is limited. 

<!--therapeutic footwear-->

At the Medical Faculty of the Otto von Guericke University Magdeburg, an experimental study with 31 healthy volunteers and 30 diabetes patients diagnosed with severe polyneuropathy was conducted to quantify pressure- and posture-dependent changes of plantar temperatures as a surrogate of tissue perfusion. 
For this purpose, plantar pressure and temperature changes in the feet were recorded during extended phases of standing. 
Custom-made shoe insoles <!--!!! cite Grützner-->
equipped with eight temperature sensors and eight pressure sensors at preselected positions were used for data acquisition (\@ref(fig:02-df-infrared-sole-sensor-positions-plot) (a)). 
The insoles were positioned into closed protective shoes specifically developed for diabetes patients. 
Within such shoes the temperature increases over time due to exchange with the body temperature of the user and is also affected by the environmental temperature. 
To closely monitor the in-shoe temperature changes one sensor was placed at the bottom of the insole without contact to the feet, which was denoted "ambient temperature sensor". 

(ref:02-df-infrared-sole-sensor-positions-plot) (a) Sensor positioning in relation to foot placement. (b) Infrared images of a healthy volunteer in a seated position without pressure application to the feet (before) and following positioning of a 20 kg weight on both upper thighs. A time-dependent decrease of temperature was detected predominantly in the forefoot, visualized by yellow color during the pressure load. Within 1 min of pressure release, a rapid temperature rise was detected.

```{r 02-df-infrared-sole-sensor-positions-plot, fig.cap="(ref:02-df-infrared-sole-sensor-positions-plot)", out.width="100%", echo=FALSE, fig.scap="fig.scap", eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/02-df-infrared-sole-sensor-positions.png")
```

The data acquisition started immediately after putting on the shoes. 
The participants were asked to follow a predefined sequence of actions, that are alternating postures of standing (stance phase) and seating (pause). 
The sessions consisted of six stance episodes, lasting 5, 10, 20, 5, 10 and 20 minutes each, separated by seating episodes lasting 5 min each.
<!--In between, the participants were asked to take up a sitting position for 5 minutes, and to release the pressure off their feet. -->
The participants were instructed to apply pressure equally on both feet while standing. 
Participants did not receive immediate feedback of the actual pressure application during the sessions, however study nurses verbally encouraged to keep the pressure without release while standing. 
In the seated position the participants were instructed to release pressure for 5 minutes, while still keeping contact to the insole. 
The participants were explicitly asked to adhere to these instructions, e.g. they should not temporarily release pressure during a stance episode. 
The study protocol furthermore encompassed that the measurements were performed twice, once at room temperature of ca 22°C and once outdoors with an ambient temperature of ca. 16°C. 
The two measurements were performed on two independent days.

The termographic images in Figure \@ref(fig:02-df-infrared-sole-sensor-positions-plot) (b) exemplarily visualize changes of plantar temperature, for a healthy volunteer in a seated position, before pressure application (1), after placement of a 20 kg weight on the front of the upper thighs (2-6), and after removal of the additional weight (7-8). 
During pressure load, a gradual temporal temperature decrease was detected predominantly in the forefoot. 
After pressure release, a rapid temperature rise within 1 min was observed.



### The Intracranial Aneurysm Angiography Image Dataset (IAD)

<!-- **The intracranial aneurysm angiography image dataset (IAD)**. The "intracranial aneurysm angiography image dataset" (AD) contains angiographical image data of 74 patients with a total of 100 intracranial aneurysms&nbsp;[@Niemann:CBMS2018].  -->
<!-- Intracranial aneurysms are pathologic dilations of the intracranial vessel wall, bearing the risk of rupture and thus subarachnoidal hemorrhages with often fatal consequences for the patient.  -->
<!-- Since treatment may cause severe complications as well, the goal is to generate models that can separate between ruptured and non-ruptured aneurysms.  -->

Retrospective clinical 

Intracranial aneurysms are pathologic dilations of the intracranial vessel wall, often in form of a dilation. <!--outward bulging-->
They bear a a risk of rupture which then lead to subarachnoidal hemorrhages with often fatal consequences for the patient. 
Since treatment can also cause severe complications, extensive studies were conducted to assess the patient-individual rupture risk based on various parameters, including aneurysm symptomatology, size and location, as well as patient age and gender [@Wermer2007]. 
Further studies identified parameters, such as aspect ratio, undulation index and nonsphericity index as statistically significant with respect to aneurysm rupture status [@Dhar2008; @Xiang2011].  
However, although these studies allow for a retrospective analysis, the clinician needs further guidance in case an asymptomatic aneurysm (as accidental finding) was detected and the rupture risk should be determined. 

We developed methods for the _"Intracranial Aneurysm Angiography Image Dataset"_ (IAD) comprising 3D rotational angiography data from 74 patients (age: 33-85 years, 17 male and 57 female patients) of the university hospital of Magdeburg, Germany, adding up to a total of 100 intracranial aneurysms. 
We identified two primary goals for this dataset: (i) build models that can accurately predict rupture status based on morphological parameters only, and (ii) assess the importance of these parameters to the models with optimal accuracy. 

<!-- We model our classification problem with a two-class target feature (\emph{unruptured} vs. \emph{ruptured}), using the 100 samples described in subsection~\ref{subsec:data_acquisition} and the 22 morphological parameters from Table~\ref{tab:features} as input features. %   -->
Inspired by the results of Baharoglu et al.&nbsp;[@BaharogluEtAl:Neurosurgery2012] who found differences between sidewall and bifurcation aneurysms (cf. Figure&nbsp;\@ref(fig:02-aneurd-sw-bf)) regarding the relationship of several morphological parameters and rupture status, we learn distinct models for the subset of sidewall aneurysms (9 (37.5%) of 24 ruptured) and for the subset of bifurcation aneurysms (29 (46.8%) of 62 ruptured). 
Moreover, we run experiments on a combined group (43 of 100 ruptures) which includes 14 samples that could not be clearly determined to be either sidewall or bifurcation aneurysms.

### The Tinnitus Patients Observational Therapy Study Dataset (CHA) {#cha}

<!-- **The Charité tinnitus patients observational therapy study dataset (CHA)**. This dataset contains information on a cohort of a total of 3,971 tinnitus patients who had been treated at the Tinnitus Center of the Charité University Medicine in Berlin between January 2011 and October 2015.  -->
<!-- All patients had been suffering from tinnitus for 3 months or longer, were 18 years of age or older and had sufficient knowledge of the German language.  -->
<!-- <!-- Treatment comprised a 7-day multi-modal treatment encompassing tinnitus-specific components, CBT, physiotherapy and information counselling.  --> -->
<!-- At registration, patients were asked to complete 15 questionnaires on socio-demographics, tinnitus-related distress, frequency, loudness, localization and quality as well as physical and mental health status, including levels of depression and perceived stress.  -->
<!-- <!-- Clinicians analyzed the questionnaire answers to derive patient-tailored treatment pathways. --> -->
<!-- To assess efficacy of the treatment, patients filled the same battery of questionnaires a second time.  -->

Tinnitus is the perception of a phantom sound in absence of an external sound source. 
It is a complex multi-factorially caused and maintained phenomenon, and estimated to affect between 10% and 15% of the adult population [@Baguley:Tinnitus2013].
The associated annual economic burden amounts to US$19.4 billion in the 
United States [@Bhatt:TinnitusAnxietyDepression2017] and €6.8 billion in the Netherlands alone [@Maes:TinnitusCosts2013].
Clinical assessment of tinnitus is challenging due patient heterogeneities with respect to perception of tinnitus (laterality, pitch, sound characteristics, frequency, permanence, chronicity), risk factors (including hearing loss, temporomandibular joint disorder, aging), comorbidities (including hyperacusis, depression, sleep disorders), perceived distress, and treatment response [@Cederroth2019]. 
These differences make the identification of a suitable and effective form of treatment difficult. 
Currently, there does not exist a therapy gold standard: sound therapy (masking), informational counseling (minimal contact education), cognitive behavioral therapy and tinnitus retraining were found to be effective for some patients, but there is also evidence that not all patients benefit equally from these treatment forms [@Hobson:SoundTherapy2012; @Kroner:Counseling2003; @Henry:Counseling1996; @Martinez:CBTReview2007; @Phillips:TRT2010].

Due to the heterogeneous nature of the tinnitus symptom as well as the unclear 
evidence-base as to its treatment and management, the identification of patient subgroups is vital to stratify individual pathophysiology and treatment pathways [@Langguth:LCA2017; @Tyler:TinnitusClustering2008; @Landgrebe:TRI2010].

The "tinnitus patients observational therapy study dataset" (_CHA_) comprises self-report data from 4,103 tinnitus patients who had been treated at the Tinnitus Center of Charité University Medicine Berlin between January 2011 and October 2015. 
All patients were 18 years of age or older and had been suffering from tinnitus for at least 3 months. 
Exclusion criteria were presence of acute psychotic illness or addiction disorder, deafness and insufficient knowledge of the German language. 
Treatment comprised a multimodal 7-day program that included intensive and daily informational counseling, detailed ear-nose-throat as well as psychological diagnostics, cognitive behavior therapy interventions, hearing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation and physiotherapy.
At baseline (_T0_; before therapy commencement) and after treatment (_T1_), patients were asked to complete multiple self-report questionnaires.
These questionnaires were selected to obtain a comprehensive tinnitus assessment, including tinnitus-related distress and the psychosomatic background of tinnitus with anxiety, depression, general quality of life and experienced physical impairments.
Table&nbsp;\@ref(tab:02-cha-questionnaires) provides an overview of all questionnaires used in the analysis. 
Most questionnaires contain multiple-choice items with answers on a Likert scale. For example, the TQ contains 52 statements, such as "I am unable to enjoy listening to music because of the noises.", and respondents can give 3 possible answers: "not true" (encoded as 0), "partly true" (1) and "true" (2). 
Some questionnaires also comprise aggregated variables, called "subscales" and "total scores".
For example, the TQ total score (TQ_distress) is calculated as sum of 40 item values, where 2 items are used twice [@GoebelHiller:TF1998], yielding a value range from 0 to 84, where higher values represent higher tinnitus-related distress. 
The cutoff value 46 [@GoebelHiller:TF1998] is used to distinguish between _compensated_ (0-46) and _decompensated_ (47-84) tinnitus. 
Further, for each questionnaire, the average time to answer an item was recorded. Figure \@ref:(fig:02-cha-patient-demographics-plot) provides a graphical illustration of demographics for 3,803 (92.7%) patients with complete data for the SOZ questionnaire and TQ score.

<!-- ## MONICA -->

<!-- **MONICA**. This dataset is derived from the Danish population of the WHO project MONICA (Multinational MONItoring of trends and determinants in CArdiovascular disease). -->
<!-- MONICA is a longitudinal epidemiological cohort study focusing on risk factors of cardio-vascular diseases, as well as causes and trends regarding the differences in the mortality between countries [@WHO:MONICA1989].  -->
<!-- Overall, 37 centers from 21 countries participated in the cohort study conducted between 1976 and 2002.  -->
<!-- Accomplishments of the project include the establishment of a profound database for prevention research and improvements on treatment of cardio-vascular diseases due to the identification of risk factors such as increased cholesterol and nicotine levels.  -->
<!-- In the Danish MONICA cohort, over 30,000 residents from the south-western of Copenhagen County, aged between 25 and 74 years, participated in three waves from  1982 to 1991 [@Bronnum:DanMONICA2001].  -->
<!-- The baseline examinations were conducted in 1982-1986 (DAN-MONICA I) with the first two follow-ups in 1986-1987 (DAN-MONICA II) and in 1991-1992 (DAN-MONICA III).  -->
<!-- <!-- %Our dataset contains 400 variables from the first three study waves for a random sample of 4,000 participants. --> -->
<!-- <!-- %The variables include questionnaire answers with participant information on socio-demographics, medication, lifestyle and psychological factors, as well as anthropometrics, genetic markers and laboratory values.  --> -->
<!-- <!-- %Our binary target variable \texttt{heart\_blood\_disease} denotes whether at least one of the following disorders or conditions are present in the second follow-up: heart attack, stroke, blood clot in brain, hypertension, other heart disease. % --> -->
<!-- <!-- %Out of 2648 participants, 688 are positive w.r.t. \texttt{heart\_blood\_disease} ($\approx 26\%$). --> -->
