  abstract  = {Whilst some studies have identified gender-specific differences, there is no consensus about gender-specific determinants for prevalence rates or concomitant symptoms of chronic tinnitus such as depression or anxiety. However, gender-associated differences in psychological response profiles and coping strategies may differentially affect tinnitus chronification and treatment success rates. Thus, understanding gender-associated differences may facilitate a more detailed identification of symptom profiles, heighten treatment response rates, and help to create access for vulnerable populations that are potentially less visible in clinical settings. Our research questions are: RQ1: how do male and female tinnitus patients differ regarding tinnitus-related distress, depression severity, and treatment response, RQ2: to what extent are answers to questionnaires administered at baseline associated with gender, and RQ3: which baseline questionnaire items are associated with tinnitus distress, depression, and treatment response, while relating to one gender only? In this work, we present a data analysis workflow to investigate gender-specific differences in N = 1,628 patients with chronic tinnitus (828 female, 800 male) who completed a 7-day multimodal treatment encompassing cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), physiotherapy, auditory attention training, and information counseling components. For this purpose, we extracted 181 variables from 7 self-report questionnaires on socio-demographics, tinnitus-related distress, tinnitus frequency, loudness, localization, and quality as well as physical and mental health status. Our workflow comprises (i) training machine learning models, (ii) a comprehensive evaluation including hyperparameter optimization, and (iii) post-learning steps to identify predictive variables. We found that female patients reported higher levels of tinnitus-related distress, depression and response to treatment (RQ1). Female patients indicated higher levels of tension, stress, and psychological coping strategies rates. By contrast, male patients reported higher levels of bodily pain associated with chronic tinnitus whilst judging their overall health as better (RQ2). Variables measuring depression, sleep problems, tinnitus frequency, and loudness were associated with tinnitus-related distress in both genders and indicators of mental health and subjective stress were found to be associated with depression in both genders (RQ3). Our results suggest that gender-associated differences in symptomatology and treatment response profiles suggest clinical and conceptual needs for differential diagnostics, case conceptualization and treatment pathways.},

  abstract  = {Background
Microcirculatory defects in diabetes are linked with neuropathy and the onset of diabetic foot syndrome. In this study we quantify pressure- and posture-dependent changes of plantar temperatures as a surrogate of tissue perfusion in healthy volunteers versus diabetes patients diagnosed with neuropathy in the absence of macroangiopathy.
Methods
Healthy volunteers (n = 31) as well as patients with diabetes diagnosed with severe polyneuropathy (n = 30) were enrolled in a clinical study to test for plantar temperature changes in the feet during extended episodes of standing. These lasted between 5 and 20 min each over 95 min, in between the participants were asked to take a seated position for 5 min and release the pressure from the feet. Major macroangiopathy was excluded before study enrolment. Custom-made insoles harbored temperature and pressure sensors positioned at eight preselected positions for recording.
Findings
In both subgroups a significant plantar temperature downshift occurred within 10 min of standing, which was especially detected during the initial 45 min of the study protocol. Comparisons between healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes revealed no differences in the magnitude of temperature downshifts during stance episodes. Pressure sensor recordings revealed that healthy volunteers intermittently released pressure during the longer stance episodes due to discomfort, whereas the patients with diabetes and polyneuropathy did not.
Interpretation
Our findings demonstrate a tight plantar temperature regulation following pressure exposure. In patients with diabetes and peripheral sensoric neuropathy the temperature drop is similar to healthy volunteers. Potentially, prolonged stance periods resulting in less perfused plantar tissue may remain unrecognized with polyneuropathy, whereas discomfort develops in healthy controls.

  abstract  = {Tinnitus is a complex condition that is associated with major psychological and economic impairments - partly through various comorbidities such as depression. Understanding the interaction between tinnitus and depression may thus improve either symptom cluster's prevention, diagnosis and treatment. In this study, we developed and validated a machine learning model to predict depression severity after outpatient therapy (T1) based on variables obtained before therapy (T0). 1,490 patients with chronic tinnitus (comorbid major depressive disorder: 52.2\%) who completed a 7-day multimodal treatment encompassing tinnitus-specific components, cognitive behavioural therapy, physiotherapy and informational counselling were included. 185 variables were extracted from self-report questionnaires and socio-demographic data acquired at T0. We used 11 classification methods to train models that reliably separate between subclinical and clinical depression at T1 as measured by the general depression questionnaire. To ensure highly predictive and robust classifiers, we tuned algorithm hyperparameters in a 10-fold cross-validation scheme. To reduce model complexity and improve interpretability, we wrapped model training around an incremental feature selection mechanism that retained features that contributed to model prediction. We identified a LASSO model that included all 185 features to yield highest predictive performance (AUC = 0.87 {\textpm} 0.04). Through our feature selection wrapper, we identified a LASSO model with good trade-off between predictive performance and interpretability that used only 6 features (AUC = 0.85 {\textpm} 0.05). Thus, predictive machine learning models can lead to a better understanding of depression in tinnitus patients, and contribute to the selection of suitable therapeutic strategies and concise and valid questionnaire design for patients with chronic tinnitus with or without comorbid major depressive disorder.},

  abstract  = {<p>In diabetic patients, excessive peak plantar pressure has been identified as major risk factor for ulceration. Analyzing plantar pressure distributions potentially improves the identification of patients with a high risk for foot ulceration development. The goal of this study was to classify regional plantar pressure distributions. By means of a sensor-equipped insole, pressure recordings of healthy controls (n = 18) and diabetics with severe polyneuropathy (n = 25) were captured across eight foot regions. The study involved a controlled experimental protocol with multiple sessions, where a session contained several cycles of pressure exposure. Clustering was used to identify subgroups of study participants that are characterized by similar pressure distributions. For both analyzed groups, the number of clusters to best describe the pressure profiles was four. When both groups were combined, analysis again led to four distinct clusters. While three clusters did not separate between healthy and diabetic volunteers the fourth cluster was only represented by diabetics. Here the pressure distribution pattern is characterized by a focal point of pressure application on the forefoot and low pressure on the lateral region. Our data suggest that pressure clustering is a feasible means to identify inappropriate biomechanical plantar stress.</p>},

In this paper, we analyze how the most suspect region as group of similarly perfused and spatially connected voxels of a breast tumor contributes to distinguishing between benign and malignant tumors. We use three density-based clustering algorithms to partition a tumor in regions and depict the most suspect one, as delivered by the most stable clustering algorithm. We use the properties of this region for each tumor as input to a classifier. Our preliminary results show that the classifier separates between benign and malignant tumors, and returns predictive attributes that are intuitive to the expert.},
